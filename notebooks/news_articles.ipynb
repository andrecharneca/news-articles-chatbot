      "WASHINGTON, July 20 (Reuters) - A North Korean government-backed hacking group penetrated an American IT management company and used it as a springboard to target cryptocurrency companies, according to two sources familiar with the matter.\n",
      "The hackers broke into Louisville, Colorado-based JumpCloud in late June and used their access to the company’s systems to target its cryptocurrency company clients in an effort to steal digital cash, the sources said.\n",
      "The hack shows how North Korean cyber spies, once content with going after crypto companies one at a time, are now tackling companies that can give them access to multiple sources of bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n",
      "JumpCloud, which acknowledged the hack in a blog post last week and blamed it on a “sophisticated nation-state sponsored threat actor,” did not respond to Reuters’ questions about who was behind the hack and which clients were affected.\n",
      "A JumpCloud spokesperson said fewer than five customers had been impacted. Reuters could not ascertain whether any digital currency was ultimately stolen as a result of the hack.\n",
      "Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, (CRWD.O) which is working with JumpCloud to investigate the breach, confirmed that \"Labyrinth Chollima\" - the name it gives to a particular squad of North Korean hackers - was behind the breach.\n",
      "CrowdStrike Senior Vice President for Intelligence Adam Meyers declined to comment on what the hackers were seeking, but noted that they had a history of targeting cryptocurrency targets.\n",
      "\"One of their primary objectives has been generating revenue for the regime,\" he said.\n",
      "Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. North Korea has previously denied organizing digital currency heists, despite voluminous evidence - including U.N. reports - to the contrary.\n",
      "Independent research backed CrowdStrike's allegation.\n",
      "Cybersecurity researcher Tom Hegel, who wasn't involved in the investigation, told Reuters that the JumpCloud intrusion was the latest of several recent breaches that showed how the North Koreans have become adept at “supply chain attacks,” or elaborate hacks that work by compromising software or service providers in order to steal data - or money - from users downstream.\n",
      "“North Korea in my opinion is really stepping up their game,” said Hegel, who works for U.S. firm SentinelOne. (S.N)\n",
      "In a blog post to be published Thursday, Hegel said the digital indicators published by JumpCloud tied the hackers to activity previously attributed to North Korea.\n",
      "The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA and the FBI declined to comment.\n",
      "The hack on JumpCloud – whose products are used to help network administrators manage devices and servers – first surfaced publicly earlier this month when the firm emailed customers to say their credentials would be changed “out of an abundance of caution relating to an ongoing incident.”\n",
      "In the blog post that acknowledged that the incident was a hack, JumpCloud traced the intrusion back to June 27. The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion.\n",
      "Labyrinth Chollima is one of North Korea’s most prolific hacking groups and is said to be responsible for some of the isolated country’s most daring and disruptive cyber intrusions. Its theft of cryptocurrency has led to the loss of eye-watering sums: Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said last year that North Korean-linked groups stole an estimated $1.7 billion worth of digital cash across multiple hacks.\n",
      "CrowdStrike's Meyers said Pyongyang's hacking squads should not be underestimated.\n",
      "\"I don't think this is the last we'll see of North Korean supply chain attacks this year,\" he said.\n",

      "LONDON, July 20 (Reuters) - ABB (ABBN.S) warned on Thursday of slowing Chinese demand, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC forecast a drop in 2023 sales and Electrolux cautioned shoppers are seeking cheaper appliances, deepening worries about global corporate and economic health.\n",
      "The news cast a pall over stocks as second-quarter earnings season ramps up. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures were indicating lower, while European stocks recovered ground lost in early trade.\n",
      "ABB said its orders in China, its second-biggest market, fell 9% in the three months to the end of June, with its electrification, motion and robotics divisions all seeing lower demand.\n",

      "The comments will unsettle investors, who had hoped that Beijing's decision to abandon strict and prolonged COVID curbs at the end of last year would revive the world's second-biggest economy.\n",
      "Data this week showed China's economy grew at a frail pace in the second quarter as demand weakened at home and abroad, with post-COVID momentum faltering rapidly.\n",
      "Adding to the overall gloom, Taiwanese chipmaker TSMC (2330.TW) forecast a 10% drop in 2023 sales as global economic woes dented demand for chips used in applications as varied as cars, cellphones and servers.\n",
      "Some earnings highlighted the challenge for companies trying to protect margins after raising prices to offset high energy and raw material costs since last year.\n",

      "The next-generation spacecraft was first tested in 2020.\n",
      "Since China's space station became operational late last year, the focus has returned to a project to send astronauts to the moon by 2030, with engineers recently disclosing more details of the plan - from the type of carrier rockets to be used to the spacecraft transporting astronauts and other equipment.\n",
      "China's current Shenzhou spacecraft, based on Russia's Soyuz, can transport up to three astronauts to low-Earth orbit. It consists of a life-support and propulsion module, an in-orbit module for short-term human habitation, and a re-entry capsule for their return to earth.\n",
      "The new generation of crewed spacecraft will comprise just two parts - the propulsion and the return modules - to allow for bigger modules and larger carrying capacity of up to seven people, Zhang Bainan, chief designer of the trial version of the new-generation spacecraft, said in 2020.\n",

      "The latest evidence comes from an instrument called SHERLOC mounted on the six-wheeled rover's robotic arm that enables a detailed mapping and analysis of organic molecules. Researchers are reporting SHERLOC's findings from 10 places on two geological formations on the floor of Jezero crater.\n",
      "They obtained evidence indicating the presence of organic molecules in multiple rock samples, including some collected for potential return to Earth for future analysis. The researchers noted that evidence of such molecules is not proof of life past or present on Mars, and that non-biological processes remain a more likely explanation.\n",
      "\"Organics are the molecular building blocks of life as we know it, but can also be formed from geological processes not directly related to life. We see multiple signals that appear to vary across the formations of the crater floor and in the minerals they are associated with,\" said astrobiologist Sunanda Sharma of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, lead author of the research published this week in the journal Nature.\n",
      "Perseverance, on a mission to search for evidence of ancient life on Mars and collect samples of rock and soil for possible return to Earth, landed in February 2021 at Jezero crater, an area in the planet's northern hemisphere that once was flooded with water and home to an ancient lake basin.\n",

Scientists suspect that microbial life once could have lived in Jezero crater. They believe river channels spilled over the crater wall and created a lake more than 3.5 billion years ago.\n",
      "Signals of organic molecules were detected at all 10 places that SHERLOC - short for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman and Luminescence for Organics and Chemicals - studied on the crater floor. The rocks were igneous - volcanically formed.\n",
      "SHERLOC employs cameras, a laser and instruments called spectrometers that analyze light wavelengths to search for organic molecules that may be signs of past microbial life. Joining the Sherlock Holmes theme, SHERLOC is assisted by WATSON, a color camera for getting close-up images of rock grains and surface textures.\n",
      "The researchers do not know the specific organic compounds that SHERLOC detected, but have some clues. Study co-author Ryan Roppel, a University of Pittsburgh graduate student in chemistry, said the chemical signatures could come from compounds like benzene or naphthalene.\n",
      "\"On Earth, these are quite common in crude oil, which has a biotic origin, but we can also form these synthetically through various chemical reactions,\" Roppel said.\n",
      "\"The concentrations we've detected are generally low, but we've observed signals associated with organics on nearly every rock we've sampled,\" Roppel added.\n",
      "Roppel said the researchers cannot rule out that inorganic - metal - sources could be responsible for the some of the signals that suggest organic molecules.\n",
      "Signs of organic molecules were first detected on Mars in 2015 by a different rover called Curiosity, followed by more evidence in subsequent years. With Perseverance now detecting possible signatures of organic molecules, the evidence is accumulating that organic molecules may be relatively common on Mars, though at low levels.\n",
      "The researchers remain cautious about the findings.\n",
      "\"There are both biotic and abiotic mechanisms that can form organic molecules. Interplanetary dust, infall from meteorites or water-rock interactions can produce organics abiotically,\" Roppel said. \"On the other hand, ancient life could produce these organics as well, but this is generally a last resort hypothesis. We need to rule out all abiotic mechanisms before we jump to the conclusion that any organic molecule is a sign of life.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON, July 12 (Reuters) - NASA on Wednesday released an image obtained by the James Webb Space Telescope of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to Earth, as the U.S. space agency marked one year since it unveiled the telescope's first scientific results.\n",
      "The Webb telescope, which was launched in 2021 and began collecting data last year, has reshaped the understanding of the early universe while taking stunning pictures of the cosmos.\n",
      "The Rho Ophiuchi image was an example of that, showing a nebula - a humongous cloud of interstellar gas and dust that serves as a nursery for new stars - located in our Milky Way galaxy roughly 390 light years from Earth. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n",
      "Rho Ophiuchi is only about a million years old, a blink of the eye in cosmic time.\n",
      "\"Here, we see how new suns are forming, along with planet-forming disks appearing as small dark silhouettes. These are very similar to what we think the solar system looked like more than 4.5 billion years ago,\" said astronomer and former Webb project scientist Klaus Pontoppidan, who is now a research scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n",
      "\"As the stars and planetary systems assemble, they blow apart the dusty cocoon from which they formed in violent outbursts, as seen in red jets plowing through the cloud as a boat in water. The Rho Ophiuchi core is completely obscured by huge amounts of dust, so it is essentially invisible to telescopes working in visible light, like the Hubble telescope. Yet, Webb peers through the dust to reveal the young stars within, showing the very first stages in the life of every star,\" Pontoppidan added.\n",
      "The image, obtained in March and April of this year, shows how the jets of material emanating from young stars affect the surrounding gas and dust while lighting up molecular hydrogen. In one part of the image, a star is seen inside a glowing cave that its stellar winds carve out in space.\n",
      "\"You see an almost impressionistic nebula crowned by three bright young stars on the top. We were surprised by the size and detail of the jets and outflows,\" Pontoppidan said.\n",
      "Since becoming operational, Webb has revealed the existence of the earliest-known galaxies and black holes. It has observed large and mature but remarkably compact galaxies teeming with stars that had formed within a few hundred million years of the Big Bang event that marked the beginning of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago - far sooner than scientists had considered possible.\n",
      "\"Some would say there are few parts of astrophysics that have not been touched by Webb in one way or another. Prominent results include the discovery of new galaxies and black holes in the early universe and new views into exoplanetary atmospheres. The Rho Ophiuchi images shows how Webb gives us a new window into the formation of stars and planets,\" Pontoppidan said.\n",
      "The orbiting observatory was designed to be far more sensitive than its Hubble Space Telescope predecessor. Webb looks at the universe mainly in the infrared, while Hubble has examined it primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. Webb is able to look at greater distances and thus farther back into time than Hubble.\n",
      "\"In just one year, the James Webb Space Telescope has transformed humanity's view of the cosmos, peering into dust clouds and seeing light from faraway corners of the universe for the very first time,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said in a statement. \"Every new image is a new discovery, empowering scientists around the globe to ask and answer questions they once could never dream of.\"\n",

      "WASHINGTON, July 10 (Reuters) - It is a planet astronomers say probably should not even exist.\n",
      "Researchers said on Monday they have spotted a truly extreme planet beyond our solar system, a blazingly hot world a bit bigger than Neptune that orbits a sun-like star every 19 hours and appears to be wrapped in metallic clouds made of titanium and silicates that reflect most incoming light back into space.\n",
      "\"It's a giant mirror in space,\" said astronomer James Jenkins of Diego Portales University and the Center for Excellence in Astrophysics and Associated Technologies (CATA) in Chile, a co-author of the research published in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.\n",
      "It reflects about 80% of incoming light, making it the universe's most reflective object known. Venus, the brightest object in Earth's night sky besides the moon, is our solar system's most reflective object, enrobed in toxic sulfuric acid clouds. Venus reflects about 75% of incoming light. Earth reflects about 30%.\n",
      "The planet, named LTT9779b, and its star are located in our Milky Way galaxy about 264 light years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Sculptor. A light year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n",
      "The planet's diameter is about 4.7 times greater than Earth, and it orbits very close to its star - closer than our solar system's innermost planet Mercury's distance to the sun and 60 times closer than Earth's orbit. With blistering solar radiation from its star, its surface temperature is about 3,270 degrees Fahrenheit (1,800 degrees Celsius), hotter than molten lava.\n",
      "With its star so close, it is a wonder it has any atmosphere, according to the researchers. An atmosphere with water-based clouds, as on Earth, would have been blown away by solar radiation long ago. But they believe its clouds are metallic, a combination of titanium and silicate - the stuff that makes up most of the rocks in Earth's crust.\n",
      "\"We even think that the clouds could condense into droplets, and have titanium rain falling in parts of the atmosphere,\" Jenkins said.\n",
      "The researchers studied the planet using the European Space Agency's CHEOPS orbiting telescope.\n",
      "\"No other planet like this has been discovered to date,\" said astronomer and study lead author Sergio Hoyer of the Marseille Astrophysics Laboratory in France.\n",
      "Possessing an atmosphere while orbiting so close to its star makes it \"a planet that shouldn't exist,\" according to astronomer and study co-author Vivien Parmentier of the Côte d'Azur Observatory in France.\n",
      "\"The super-reflective cloud cover likely helped stop the planet from warming up too much and being stripped of its atmosphere,\" Parmentier said. \"This is quite unique as all other planets at this temperature that are big enough to keep their atmosphere are too hot to form clouds and are thus as dark as charcoal.\"\n",
      "It also appears to be tidally locked to its star like the moon is to Earth, with a permanent day side facing the star and a permanent night side facing away.\n",
      "All previously known planets that orbit their stars in less than one Earth day were either \"hot Jupiters,\" gas giants similar in composition to our solar system's largest planet but much hotter due to solar radiation - or rocky planets smaller than Earth and lacking an atmosphere.\n",
      "The researchers are pondering whether LTT9779b, classified as an \"ultra-hot Neptune,\" perhaps began as a gas giant only to lose most of its atmosphere, or whether it started out at its current size.\n",
      "More than 5,000 planets beyond our solar system - called exoplanets - have been discovered, many with traits vastly different than our solar system's eight planets. With increasingly capable instruments coming on line - the James Webb Space Telescope became operational last year and the Extremely Large Telescope is under construction in Chile - more discoveries await.\n",

      "WASHINGTON, July 3 (Reuters) - Time is a slippery thing, as profound thinkers like physicist Albert Einstein and, well, fictional time traveler Dr. Who plainly understood. The latter, in a 2007 episode of the British sci-fi series, accurately described time as \"wibbly wobbly.\"\n",
      "Scientists made that point anew on Monday in a study that used observations of a ferocious class of black holes called quasars to demonstrate \"time dilation\" in the early universe, showing how time then passed only about a fifth as quickly as it does today. The observations stretch back to about 12.3 billion years ago, when the universe was roughly a tenth its present age.\n",
      "Quasars - among the brightest objects in the universe - were used as a \"clock\" in the study to measure time in the deep past. Quasars are tremendously active supermassive black holes millions to billions of times more massive than our sun, usually residing at centers of galaxies. They devour matter drawn to them by their immense gravitational pull and unleash torrents of radiation including jets of high-energy particles, while a glowing disk of matter spins around them.\n",
      "The researchers used observations involving the brightness of 190 quasars across the universe dating to about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang event that gave rise to the cosmos. They compared the brightness of these quasars at various wavelengths to that of quasars existing today, finding that certain fluctuations that occur in a particular amount of time today did so five times more slowly in the most ancient quasars.\n",
      "Einstein, in his general theory of relativity, showed that time and space are intertwined and that the universe has been expanding outward in all directions since the Big Bang.\n",
      "Astrophysicist Geraint Lewis of the University of Sydney in Australia, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said this continual expansion explains how time flowed more slowly earlier in the universe's history relative to today.\n",
      "It is not as if everything was in slow motion. If you could be transported back to that time, a second would still feel like a second to you. But from the perspective of a person today, a second back then would unfold in five seconds now.\n",
      "\"In modern physics, time is a complicated thing,\" Lewis said. \"Dr. Who had it right, that time is best described as 'wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.' This means that we don't really understand time and its limitation, and some things are still not ruled out: time travel, warp drives, etc. The future could be very exciting, though maybe not.\"\n",
      "By looking at faraway objects, scientists peer back in time because of how long it takes for light to travel through space.\n",
      "Scientists previously documented time dilation dating to roughly 7 billion years ago, based on observations of stellar explosions called supernovas. Already knowing the time it takes for today's supernovas to brighten and fade, they studied these explosions in the past - those at great distances from Earth - and found that these events unfolded more slowly then from our time perspective.\n",
      "The explosion of individual stars cannot be seen beyond a certain distance away, limiting their use in studying the early universe. Quasars are so bright that they can be observed back to the universe's infant stages.\n",
      "\"What is observed over time is the quasar brightness. This fluctuates up and down, the result of lots of complicated physics in the disk of matter spinning around a black hole at almost light speed. This change in brightness is not simply a bright, fade, bright, fade. It looks more like the stock market, with small scale jitters on longer-term changes, with some sharp fluctuations,\" Lewis said.\n",
      "\"The statistical properties of the light variations contain a time scale - a typical time for the fluctuations to possess a particular statistical property. And it is this we use to set the ticking of each quasar,\" Lewis added.\n",

      "Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, (CRWD.O) which is working with JumpCloud to investigate the breach, confirmed that \"Labyrinth Chollima\" - the name it gives to a particular squad of North Korean hackers - was behind the breach.\n",

      "\"One of their primary objectives has been generating revenue for the regime,\" he said.\n",
      "Pyongyang's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. North Korea has previously denied organizing digital currency heists, despite voluminous evidence - including U.N. reports - to the contrary.\n",
      "Independent research backed CrowdStrike's allegation.\n",
      "Cybersecurity researcher Tom Hegel, who wasn't involved in the investigation, told Reuters that the JumpCloud intrusion was the latest of several recent breaches that showed how the North Koreans have become adept at “supply chain attacks,” or elaborate hacks that work by compromising software or service providers in order to steal data - or money - from users downstream.\n",
      "“North Korea in my opinion is really stepping up their game,” said Hegel, who works for U.S. firm SentinelOne. (S.N)\n",
      "In a blog post to be published Thursday, Hegel said the digital indicators published by JumpCloud tied the hackers to activity previously attributed to North Korea.\n",
      "The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA and the FBI declined to comment.\n",
      "The hack on JumpCloud – whose products are used to help network administrators manage devices and servers – first surfaced publicly earlier this month when the firm emailed customers to say their credentials would be changed “out of an abundance of caution relating to an ongoing incident.”\n",
      "In the blog post that acknowledged that the incident was a hack, JumpCloud traced the intrusion back to June 27. The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion.\n",
      "Labyrinth Chollima is one of North Korea’s most prolific hacking groups and is said to be responsible for some of the isolated country’s most daring and disruptive cyber intrusions. Its theft of cryptocurrency has led to the loss of eye-watering sums: Blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis said last year that North Korean-linked groups stole an estimated $1.7 billion worth of digital cash across multiple hacks.\n",

      "Michael Moritz, the journalist-turned-VC who has long been one of the most prominent and respected investors at Sequoia Capital, has left the firm after 38 years to “deepen his advisory relationship” with Sequoia Heritage, the wealth management unit he spun up in 2010 with colleague Doug Leone and on whose board he has sat for years.\n",
      "The move is effective immediately. In a note to LPs that we obtained earlier, Sequoia’s global managing partner, Roelof Botha, said Moritz will continue to represent Sequoia Capital at a handful of companies but that those seats will be “transitioned” to other partners over time.\n",
      "A source familiar with the firm said the development was not socialized within the partnership far in advance of its announcement to Sequoia’s investors because Moritz long ago relinquished his day-to-day responsibilities. Indeed, he stepped down from an active management role in 2012, telling investors then that he’d been diagnosed with a “rare medical condition which can be managed but is incurable” and explaining that he’d been told that “in the next five to ten years, the quality of my life is quite likely to decline.”\n",
      "Despite the adjustment, Moritz has continued to be involved at Sequoia, with some of his nine board seats newer than others. For example, he sits on the board of Getir, the Turkey-based instant delivery company that Moritz’s family office backed in 2020 before Sequoia wrote the company a check. Others of his board seats include Instacart, the U.S.-based delivery outfit; Strava, the social network for athletes; Klarna, the Stockholm-based payment outfit that last year accepted new funding at a starkly lower valuation than the previous year; and San Francisco-based Stripe, which may prove one of Sequoia’s biggest outcomes to date.\n",
      "In contrast, when Leone stepped down last year from his role as “Senior Steward” of Sequoia to be replaced by Botha, who was previously managing partner of Sequoia’s U.S. and Europe operations, the move was roughly two years in the making given the many hats the role requires.\n",
      "At Sequoia, stepping away is often an attenuated process. Leone continues to be part of both Sequoia’s seed and growth teams. So does another past manager at Sequoia, Jim Goetz, who oversaw Sequoia’s U.S. business with Botha until 2017 and who continues to make new investments for the firm from his perch in Miami, Fl. (Firm founder Don Valentine famously attended partner meetings for 10 years after handing the reins to Moritz and Leone.)\n",
      "Moritz, however, will not be making new investments, and perhaps inevitably, that has raised eyebrows in some corners, particularly given that Sequoia has undergone a string of other recent changes.\n",
      "In a piece published earlier today, the Financial Times quotes one venture capitalist who has invested alongside Moritz and Sequoia and who reportedly said Moritz’s departure risks leaving a “leadership gap” at Sequoia. “It’s been a long time coming, but it comes at a bad time.”\n",
      "The world of startup investing is still recovering from years of froth, for one thing. Further, in one of the most dramatic moves in Sequoia’s history, the firm — which has enjoyed tremendous success around the globe — announced early last month that it had decided to break up, with Sequoia’s China and India and Southeast Asia funds relaunching as new firms: HongShan and Peak XV Partners.\n",
      "In an interview with Forbes, Botha, along with the firms’ two other investment heads, Neil Shen and Sailendra Singh, said the decision tied to conflicts between the funds’ respective portfolios and downplayed a geopolitical environment that has made it nearly impossible for U.S. investors to fund China deals in particular and vice versa.\n",
      "It wasn’t the only big shift for Sequoia. Less than two years ago, the firm announced that it was “breaking with the traditional organization” based on fund cycles and restructuring Sequoia Capital around a singular, permanent structure that would allow it to hold public shares long after a portfolio goes public (versus distributing the shares to its investors). The decision, said Sequoia, would also enable the firm to “further increase our investments in emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies.”\n",
      "While over the long term the move may prove fruitful, its timing proved inauspicious. Roughly six months after Sequoia restructured, the broader markets tanked, dragging down the price of public company shares that Sequoia’s investors might otherwise have sold. Sequoia also suffered a rare embarrassment when FTX, the crypto exchange into which Sequoia plugged more than $200 million, imploded nearly overnight owing to mismanagement.\n",
      "Partner Alfred Lin told this editor later that the investment represented a reasonable amount from a risk management perspective when considering the $6.3 billion multibillion-dollar fund from which Sequoia’s checks were written. But a growth-stage investor who worked with Lin on that deal, Michelle Fradin, has since left Sequoia in search of an operating role.\n",
      "And there have been other departures. Two investors, Kais Khimji and Daniel Chen, have left to spin up two different AI companies, both of them backed by Sequoia. (Sequoia has a history of backing its own investors, including Nubank founder David Vélez.) Also gone: Mike Vernal, a former Facebook VP who joined Sequoia as a partner in 2016 and who is taking time off until the end of this year, according to a source familiar with Vernal’s plans.\n",
      "Vernal had a more senior role compared with the others, including to help oversee Sequoia’s “scout” program, wherein founders in its portfolio and their friends are given the ability to write checks from Sequoia and to share in any later rewards. Now, longtime partners Bryan Schreier and Jess Lee oversee the program along with Ian Taylor, who joined Sequoia last summer after spending three years with the seed-stage firm Pear VC.\n",
      "Dealbook reported first on Moritz’s departure; The Information reported first on the departures of Vernal, Khimji, Chen, and Fradin.\n",
      "Like any firm of its size and reach, Sequoia has also been hiring new talent. Earlier this year, David Cahn agreed to join Sequoia Capital as a partner on its growth team after spending more than five years with Coatue Management. Sequoia more recently poached a principal from Accel — Julien Bek — who joined its growing London-based practice.\n",
      "Either way, Moritz won’t be traveling far to spend time with the team at Sequoia Heritage, which was seeded by $150 million from Moritz’s own money, $150 million from Leone, and $250 million from outside investors who they brought in.\n",
      "Run by head investors Keith Johnson and Kevin Kelly, the separate legal entity holds office space in the same building as Sequoia Capital. Sequoia Capital Global Equities, Sequoia’s hedge fund unit, also has an office there.\n",
      "According to a recent Bloomberg piece, Heritage was designed to work closely with Sequoia but has always retained the right to make its own investment decisions. It has made some good decisions, evidently; its assets under management reportedly grew from $4.2 billion in April 2018 to $16.4 billion as of this past April.\n",
      "As for Sequoia Capital’s assets, which are separate from Sequoia Heritage and Sequoia Capital Global Equities, they’ve been trending down along with the broader startup market. As flagged by Bloomberg, those assets recently stood at $55.58 billion, per an SEC filing, compared with $85 billion at the end of 2021.\n",

      "Netflix is bringing password-sharing crackdown to consumers in India and every other market starting today, the global streaming giant said after a limited rollout of the restriction helped the firm sign up nearly 6 million subscribers in the quarter ending June.\n",
      "The streaming giant said it will start to address account sharing between households in almost all of its remaining countries starting Thursday. Netflix, which once supported the practice of account password-sharing, now finds it posing complex challenges to its business prospects.\n",
      "It began testing the restriction last year, much to many subscribers’ chagrin, and expanded it to a number of other countries including Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and the U.S. in 2023. In some aforementioned markets, Netflix allowed those sharing the password to pay extra to accommodate their friends.\n",
      "The firm has clarified that it won’t be introducing an additional membership option for customers in countries where it’s newly enforcing account sharing restrictions. The reason behind this decision is the relatively low market penetration in these markets, along with the availability of more economical Netflix subscription tiers, the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n",
      "“In these markets, we’re not offering an extra member option given that we’ve recently cut prices in a good number of these countries (for example, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya, and India) and penetration is still relatively low in many of them so we have plenty of runway without creating additional complexity. Households borrowing Netflix will be able to transfer existing profiles to new and existing accounts.”\n",
      "Netflix’s password-sharing crackdown helped deliver a robust subscriber growth in the quarter ending June, the company said on Wednesday. Following a loss of nearly 1 million customers in the same quarter last year, the company said it now gained 5.9 million subscribers. This increase is largely due to individuals who, no longer able to share the service at no cost, have chosen to pay for their own accounts.\n",
      "Netflix CFO Spence Neumann said that the revenue growth for the firm is “largely driven by our paid sharing rollout.” He added: “It is our primary revenue accelerator in the year, and we expect that impact … to build over several quarters.”\n",
      "The ongoing effort against password-sharing could potentially further challenge Netflix’s competitive edge in various markets. Take India, for example, where Netflix faces stiff competition from JioCinema, a platform backed by James Murdoch and Mukesh Ambani. JioCinema not only streams numerous popular shows and movies from NBC, HBO, and Warner Bros., but it also hosts some of the region’s most sought-after sporting events. JioCinema’s annual subscription costs about $12.\n",

      "Here’s another edition of “Ask Sophie,” the advice column that answers immigration-related questions about working at technology companies.\n",
      "“Your questions are vital to the spread of knowledge that allows people all over the world to rise above borders and pursue their dreams,” says Sophie Alcorn, a Silicon Valley immigration attorney. “Whether you’re in people ops, a founder or seeking a job in Silicon Valley, I would love to answer your questions in my next column.”\n",

      "Dear Sophie,\n",
      "With more than 750,000 H-1B registrations this year, is it realistic for my early-stage startup to consider hiring candidates who are seeking them?\n",
      "— Skeptical Startup\n",
      "Dear Skeptical,\n",
      "I know, I know: The numbers are intense.\n",
      "I understand your skepticism given that the odds of companies getting their H-1B visa candidates selected in the annual lottery process have been on the decline as demand among employers for H-1B visas continues to rise. Despite some well-publicized layoffs, many employers continue to hire, plus the CHIPS Act of 2022 and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 are spurring more job creation.\n",
      "For this year’s H-1B lottery, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) received a whopping 758,994 eligible registrations, and for the first time, more than half — nearly 408,900 — were H-1B candidates who had more than one employer that registered them in the lottery. (How does the annual lottery work? Check out my podcast for an overview.)\n",
      "Again this year, with no second lottery on the horizon, these are important questions to ask.\n",
      "Still, I believe it’s still worth it to register employees in the annual H-1B lottery as part of a multiprong strategy to attract and retain international talent in the United States, as the six-year, dual-intent status is so valuable to companies and the team members who hold it.\n",
      "That remains true even if the USCIS implements a proposal to increase the H-1B lottery registration fee to $215, up from the recent $10 fee. Although it’s a large increase, the additional $205 per registration likely won’t be a limiting factor for even early-stage startups considering the process.\n",
      "The chances of having an H-1B candidate picked in the lottery has dropped dramatically, particularly since 2020, when the USCIS implemented its online H-1B lottery registration system. Before 2020, companies that wanted to enter an employee or prospective employee in the H-1B lottery had to submit a completed H-1B application.\n",
      "This time-intensive, costly, and risky process often meant that participating in the H-1B lottery was unrealistic for most startups. Additionally, companies had to be ready to front the full filing fees at the time of the lottery, not knowing how many people would be selected and how many checks would be cashed. Now it’s easy to register candidates, and companies have discretion about whether to proceed with the full petition after knowing whether somebody was selected.\n",
      "Raising the annual cap of 85,000 H-1B visas (65,000 for those with bachelor’s degrees and 20,000 for those with master’s or higher degrees) requires congressional approval and remains highly unlikely. However, the USCIS could look at alternative administrative changes, such as limiting each H-1B candidate to one entry in the H-1B lottery regardless if that individual has multiple job offers, in order to provide a more level playing field.\n",
      "This year’s H-1B lottery\n",
      "While getting job offers from multiple companies that register an H-1B candidate in the lottery is not against the law, the USCIS indicated it would closely scrutinize H-1B beneficiaries, companies, and applications for potential abuses and fraud.\n",
      "After this year’s lottery, the USCIS stated:\n",
      "The large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple eligible registrations — much larger than in previous years — has raised serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary. This may have unfairly increased their chances of selection.\n",
      "If any of your early-stage employees are on F-1 Optional Practical Training (OPT) or STEM OPT, the two-year extension for students who graduated in a STEM field, make sure to enter them in the H-1B lottery every March until they are selected before they graduate and while they are maintaining OPT and STEM OPT status. You can look at other visa alternatives as well.\n",
      "Visas for citizens of specific countries\n",
      "You have other options if your startup’s employees or prospective employees aren’t selected in the H-1B lottery. There are a handful of work visas aimed at individuals from certain countries. If any of your employees or prospective employees are from Australia, Canada, Chile, Mexico, or Singapore, these are great options to consider:\n",

      "TikTok has finally launched an ads transparency library — starting with data on ads and other commercial content running in Europe but with plans to expand that.\n",
      "Also today it’s announced expanded access to its research API to Europe.\n",
      "Both moves look intended to help the company comply with incoming requirements under the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA). Back in April, the video-sharing social network was confirmed as one of 19 so-called very large online platforms (VLOPs) under the DSA — a designation which brings a suite of additional compliance requirements related to algorithmic transparency and accountability.\n",
      "To wit: Article 39 of the pan-EU regulation requires VLOPs whose platforms display ads to offers a searchable database of ads with information, including who paid for the ad, the main targeting parameters and data on views. While Article 40 concerns data access for vetted and other external researchers to further the regulation’s goal of ensuring that systemic risks flowing from major platforms are able to be robustly studied.\n",
      "“Today, we’re expanding access to our Research API to Europe and opening up new transparency tools for commercial content,” TikTok wrote in a blog post announcing the launches. “These tools are designed to enhance transparency about content on our platform and are informed by feedback we’re hearing from researchers and civil society.”\n",
      "A TikTok spokesman confirmed the research API is being made available to researchers working across Europe, not only those at institutions inside the EU — so it’s also open to applications from academics working in the EEA (European Economic Area), Switzerland and the UK.\n",
      "The social media platform announced it was developing an API for researchers last summer — when it said it would provide select researchers with more transparency about its platform and moderation system by giving access to public and anonymized data about content and activity on the app. An initial version of the Research API was ready for testing by members of TikTok’s Content and Safety Advisory Councils in November — before being opened up to academic researchers in the US earlier this year, in February.\n",
      "So far, the free API has seen more than 60 applications from US non-profit academic researchers on topics including those related to consumer trends, misinformation and mental health, per TikTok.\n",
      "The impact of social media platforms on young people’s lives and well-being continues to be a topic of discussion and concern in mainstream media. But scientists have warned we still don’t have robust data to draw strong conclusions — hence the push by EU lawmakers to make major platforms open up to outside scrutiny.\n",
      "TikTok’s approach for the research API requires researchers to create an account and complete an application which it reviews to ensure its criteria are met before granting access. So it said it expects the first non-profit academic researchers in Europe to get access “in the coming weeks”.\n",
      "TikTok’s criteria for access to the API require regional researchers to have demonstrable academic experience and expertise in the research area specified in the application; no conflicts of interest with respect to using the services; a clearly defined research proposal; and to be committed to only using the data for non-commercial purposes.\n",
      "Also today, it said it’s working on being able to grant researchers who are collaborating with others the ability to work together on a shared research project. This incoming collaboration feature, which it says it’s adding in response to feedback from early users, will be called “Lab Access”.\n",
      "“More than half the applications we’ve received request collaboration with other researchers, so we’ll soon be allowing up to 10 researchers to work together on a shared research project,” it wrote. “All researchers will need to have their own TikTok for Developers account and be located in the US or Europe to access our Research API.\n",
      "“Principal researchers will be able to submit a single application for collaborators from the same university. Projects involving multiple universities will need to submit separate applications for each school.”\n",
      "Ads transparency at last\n",
      "The ads transparency library, or “Commercial Content Library” as TikTok is billing it, is a newer initiative — and the launch plugs a long-standing transparency gap for the platform.\n",
      "A critical report on TikTok by Mozilla, back in mid 2021, found policy loopholes, lax oversight around influencer marketing and the lack of a public, searchable ads database was making the platform vulnerable to passing off political ads as organic content — rendering TikTok’s official policy banning political ads pretty meaningless.\n",
      "Now anyone can search TikTok ads or other commercial content by country, date and keyword.\n",
      "However — big caveat! — for now only data on commercial stuff running in Europe is available. TikTok said it plans to include data from “more countries” in the future (but did not specify where or when).\n",
      "“The Commercial Content Library is a searchable database with information about paid ads and ad metadata, such as the advertising creative, dates the ad ran, main parameters used for targeting (e.g. age, gender), number of people who were served the ad, and more,” TikTok noted.\n",
      "The tool also includes information about other content that’s “commercial in nature and tagged with either a paid partnership label or promotional label, such as content that promotes a brand, product or service but is not a paid ad” — so TikTok is including influence marketing in the database too (or at least it is if the influencers have correctly tagged their videos).\n",
      "“We tested an early version of the Commercial Content Library with researchers and civil society to gather feedback over the last few months before making it more broadly available,” TikTok added. “From our tests and input from experts, we’ve added the ability to perform precise searches, included more targeting parameters, and improved data quality — among other updates.”\n",
      "TikTok is also providing access to a Commercial Content API to enable researchers to query the ads database.\n",
      "“Researchers will need to create a TikTok Developers account and submit an application to access the Commercial Content API which we review to help prevent malicious actors from misusing this data,” it added.\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/tesla-hits-25b-in-q2-revenue-but-margins-decrease-amid-price-cuts/\n",
      "Tesla reported Wednesday net income of $2.7 billion in the second quarter, up 20% from the same period last year as once again, the company’s EV price cuts dug into profits. The automaker has repeatedly reduced the cost of its four EV models in the United States, Mexico, Europe and China. The move helped boost sales in the first half of the year, with Tesla hitting record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 units. But it’s also taken chunks out of Tesla’s normally healthy automotive margins.\n",
      "For the second time this year, Tesla’s gross margins decreased to 18.2%, down from 25% in Q2 2022 and down from 19.3% last quarter.\n",
      "Tesla matched Wall Street revenue estimates of around $25 billion for the quarter, which is nearly 50% higher than year-ago sales of $16.9 billion. Most of the revenue came from Tesla’s automotive revenue, which hit $21.3 billion in Q2. That number includes $282 million from federal tax incentives.\n",
      "A small, but notable, chunk of Tesla’s Q2 revenue came from “services and other revenue,” which usually includes after-sales vehicle services and parts, retail merchandise, vehicle insurance and the Supercharger network.\n",
      "Tesla’s number of Supercharger stations and connectors increased 33% in the second quarter to 5,265 and 48,082, respectively. The automaker has been opening its network of Superchargers to other automakers in recent months, notably Ford and General Motors, and most recently Nissan. While charging isn’t a main revenue driver for Tesla, it’s possible that some of the increase came from Tesla opening up its charging network.\n",
      "Energy generation and storage revenue remained flat quarter-over-quarter, but grew 74% year-over-year.\n",
      "Tesla’s operating margin dropped slightly from 11.4% in Q1 to 9.6% in Q2. Its capital expenditures remained flat QoQ but increased 19% YoY. The company reported it spent $2 billion in capital expenditures, likely due to continued production ramping in the automaker’s Berlin and Texas gigafactories. Tesla’s Q2 earnings show that Berlin’s vehicle capacity increased by 25,000 units over Q1 reported numbers.\n",
      "Tesla closed out the quarter with $1 billion in free cash flow, which is up from the $441 million with which it finished the first quarter.\n",
      "Tesla stock closed at $291.26 Wednesday and dropped 5% in after-hours trading.\n",
      "Tesla’s 2023 outlook\n",
      "Tesla’s full-year outlook hasn’t changed.\n",
      "“For 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year,” reads Tesla’s earnings report.\n",
      "In Q1, Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles globally. In the second quarter, that number hit 466,140 units, a 10% increase. If Tesla’s production and delivery capacity keeps increasing at around the same clip, the automaker will be able to reach close to 2 billion units by the end of the year.\n",
      "However, Musk did say Wednesday that Q3 production will decrease slightly, driven by planned downtime for factory upgrades. He noted that macroeconomic conditions are uncertain and could impact execution positively or negatively in the near term.\n",
      "Musk also defended Tesla’s many price cuts, saying it was a move to combat the potential for lower sales amid economic uncertainty.\n",
      "“When interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car,” said Musk.\n",
      "The executive noted that Tesla had also brought back its referral program in an effort to boost sales.\n",
      "Cybertruck information still lacking\n",
      "Tesla finally built its much-delayed Cybertruck over the weekend at Giga Austin, but few details were shared at the time. During Wednesday’s earnings report, the company still left investors and analysts wanting more.\n",
      "“It’s always very difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year,” said CEO Elon Musk Wednesday.\n",
      "Musk also noted that “demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook,” emphasizing that the Cybertruck has “a lot of new technology…so the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain.”\n",
      "Tesla didn’t provide other information on the Cybertruck, like production capacity next year, pricing and more specs.\n",
      "This story has been updated with information from Tesla’s Q2 earnings call.\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/indrive-brings-its-bid-based-ride-hail-app-to-the-us/\n",
      "InDrive (formerly inDriver) is bringing a new type of ride-hailing app to South Florida. The startup operates a “bid-based” platform wherein passengers can name their own fare for a ride, and nearby drivers can accept, decline or counter the offer.\n",
      "At a time when ride-hail customers are feeling squeezed by higher fares and drivers are classified as independent contractors but given no say over how much they charge for rides, such a business model can be attractive.\n",
      "InDrive officially launched in Miami, its first U.S. market, Thursday. The company says it has more than 175 million downloads and is present in 655 cities across 48 countries.\n",
      "If you’ve never heard of InDrive, it might be because the company has more of a presence outside the traditional Western world. Originally from Siberia, InDrive divested its Russian entity in July 2022 after Russia’s war with Ukraine began in March that year. The company says it has no other plans for investment in Russia.\n",
      "InDrive’s top markets are in Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador) and Asia (Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Pakistan, India).\n",
      "In February InDrive raised $150 million in debt financing from General Catalyst, and since then has been expanding aggressively into new territories. The company recently announced plans to expand to 15 new cities in Nigeria, and has had a presence in Africa for years.\n",
      "So why America, and why now? Adam Warner, U.S. country manager, told TechCrunch that InDrive’s strong foothold in LatAm was one of the drivers for launching in South Florida, specifically Miami.\n",
      "“We’ve really built our entire business model guided on freedom of choice,” said Warner. “Our pricing is not determined by some kind of computer program. It’s really open for drivers and passengers to negotiate the price of each ride, while drivers are also not penalized for declining orders. So unlike my peers, we put the drivers and consumers first by bringing transparency and fairness to ride-sharing.”\n",
      "Sounds great! What could go wrong?\n",
      "Apparently a few things.\n",
      "A quick perusal of app reviews demonstrate a plethora of issues customers have had with the app and the service — issues that probably won’t fly with an American audience.\n",
      "Uber and Lyft, for all their questionable ethics, ensure reliable rides and service by hitting drivers with a combination of incentives and punishments for accepting or declining rides. InDrive has more of a conscience, but that could lead to longer wait times for riders or riders repeatedly getting canceled on.\n",
      "Warner said InDrive is working on its marketing push to get as many drivers signed up as possible so that if one driver cancels, there will be another waiting in the wings. One way the company is attracting drivers is by refraining from charging a commission from July 2023 to January 2024, meaning the drivers will take home up to 100% of each fare (subject to airport fees and highway tolls). InDrive’s usual fee is around 10% of each ride. Uber and Lyft take 25%.\n",
      "The company is also promising to maintain a minimum ride price of $10 in Miami. Today, InDrive has 3,500 drivers in South Florida signed up for launch.\n",
      "Customers also complained about InDrive’s customer service being sub-par when dealing with issues like frequent driver cancellations, or drivers changing up the agreed upon fare at pickup. Warner said InDrive has customer service teams in Mexico and Malaysia (but crucially not in the U.S.) to deal with any issues that come up.\n",
      "InDrive has raised about $387 million in total, according to Crunchbase. That’s not a small number, but compared to competitors, it does mean InDrive has had to stay lean, which can affect the quality of the product. Customers reviewing the app also complained that it was buggy, that ETAs were off, and that drivers didn’t always know how to get from A to B. Part of that last problem is because InDrive doesn’t have its own proprietary mapping and GPS system, as its peers do, which Warner says is a huge cost.\n",
      "“We give the drivers the freedom of choice to be able to switch on their own mapping services,” said Warner. “We’re not heavily invested into that particular part of it. We rely pretty heavily on partnerships with Google Maps, Waze, Apple Maps, et cetera.”\n",
      "If InDrive wants to compete with the likes of Uber and Lyft, it’ll have to get its customer service and app sorted. But that’s not impossible, and InDrive isn’t in a huge rush to take over the U.S.\n",
      "Warner said the company is focused on solving the transportation needs in South Florida first, and doing so in a way that’s sustainable.\n",
      "“InDrive is definitely open to expanding its footprint in the United States, really focusing on markets with insufficient mobility and public transportation options,” said Warner. “Also markets that have high travel costs and emerging tourism.”\n",

      "Google continues the rollout of its Privacy Sandbox APIs — its replacement for tracking cookies for the online advertising industry. Today, right on schedule and in time for the launch of Chrome 115 into the stable release channel, Google announced that it will now start enabling the relevance and measurement APIs in its browser. This will be a gradual rollout, with Google aiming for a 99% availability by mid-August.\n",
      "At this point, Google doesn’t expect to make any major changes to the APIs. This includes virtually all of the core Privacy Sandbox features, including Topics, Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting, Private Aggregation, Shared Storage and Fenced Frames.\n",
      "It’s worth noting that for the time being, Privacy Sandbox will run in parallel with third-party cookies in the browser. It won’t be until early 2024 that Google will deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users. After that, the process will speed up though and Google will deprecate these cookies for all users by the second half of 2024.\n",
      "Previously, the ad tech industry was already able to test its readiness for the eventual third-party cookie deprecation, in part through the Relevance and Measurement origin trial. With these features moving into general availability, Google will end this trial (and revoke the tokens to run experiments) on September 20, 2023.\n",
      "For Chrome users, Google will also now start rolling out its user interface to allow them to manage Privacy Sandbox data in the browser, including ad topics, site-suggested ads and ad measurement data. This rollout will run in parallel with the API releases.\n",
      "Google will soon make enrollment and attestation a mandatory process for ad tech companies that want to access these APIs on Chrome and Android, though they will be able to continue to do some local testing as well.\n",
      "“Shipping these APIs is another key milestone in the ongoing Privacy Sandbox timeline,” Google notes in today’s announcement. “This marks the beginning of the transition from sites testing in the origin trial to integrating these APIs in production. We will be keeping you updated as we progress through enabling the APIs, to the opt-in testing with labels in Q4 2023, the 1% third-party cookie deprecation in Q1 2024, heading towards the full third-party cookie phaseout in Q3 2024.”\n",

      "Just like many other streaming services, YouTube has increased the prices of its Premium plan for individuals in the U.S. from $11.99 per month to $13.99 per month.\n",
      "The price hike follows last year’s price bump in family plans in many countries. In the U.S. the family plan tariff went from $17.99 per month to $22.99 per month. The individual plan change, first spotted by 9to5Google, is live on the YouTube Premium page.\n",
      "YouTube confirmed the move to TechCrunch and said the price hike will affect all — current and new — subscribers.\n",
      "“We’re updating the price for YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the US to continue delivering great service and features. We believe this new price reflects the value of YouTube Premium which allows subscribers to enjoy ad-free YouTube with background and offline play and uninterrupted access to over 100M songs with the YouTube Music app,” a company spokesperson said.\n",
      "The company said that users will have to pay the updated prices from their next billing cycle. It added that folks who subscribed to YouTube Premium five years ago, when the plan was launched, will get three additional months at their current price.\n",
      "With YouTube Premium, Google offers ad-free viewing, the ability to download videos, 1080p streaming of higher quality, the ability to resume videos from where you left off, and access to YouTube Music. The company also releases experimental features for Premium subscribers, such as the ability to change playback speed and a lock screen feature to avoid accidental touches.\n",
      "Google is also hiking the price of the YouTube Music plan from $9.99 per month to $10.99 per month. This follows subscription price raises from Apple Music and Amazon Music, which also offer their streaming at the same price. Spotify’s individual plan still costs $9.99 per month.\n",
      "Over the last few months, rival video services such as Apple TV+, Paramount+, and Peacock, have announced price hikes. While Netflix raised its prices last year, the company commenced a crackdown on password sharing, making users pay more or add an extra member to their plans.\n",

      "With the cost of living ever more painful, and Generative AI supposedly gunning for your job, at least — for the moment — it might be here to save you some money on your household bills.\n",
      "UK-based cost-of-living start-up Nous.co has now launched an OpenAI-powered assistant (combined with its own proprietary systems) to help its users understand and manage their household bills. Users will be able to upload bills or connect their email inbox to have bills forwarded to the assistant automatically. It then categorises and summarises the bills, alerting customers to details and potential savings.\n",
      "Nous claims it can now save households up to £1,000 a year or more via its AI-driven system, and around £126 on average. It also says it can spot it when suppliers’ try to send estimated bills rather than final ones.\n",
      "The new feature is on the free tier of Nous membership, currently works with energy bills and will soon be extended to broadband, mobile phone and insurance documents, with alerts delivered via WhatsApp.\n",
      "According to the company’s own research, two thirds of people in the UK find it difficult to understand their energy bills and only 15% say they read the small print.\n",
      "After just over 12 months of development in private beta, Nous soon plans to offer a subscription service as its premium product, focusing on clear billing and customer reassurance regarding data privacy. The free product will serve as an onboarding tool and customer acquisition funnel for the premium service. The startup relies on open banking regulations to access consumer spending data.\n",
      "Greg Marsh, co-founder and CEO of Nous, told me: “We knew intellectually AI would be part of the story for this service. It offers automation and scale. What I hadn’t got clear until this year was how powerful it was to unlock customer value. The combination of LLMs, our domain knowledge and our connections with commercial suppliers is very powerful. But AI is front and centre of this.”\n",
      "He says that given most people find trawling through their bills boring, utilities and insurance companies can sometimes use that as an opportunity to “bury nasty surprises”. He says Generative AI is “perfectly suited to catching this stuff straight away.”\n",
      "He says Nous has has has has thousand of people use the service but he doesn’t want to be in the business of monetising the data: “We use it to enhance the user. The typical insurance contract requires 44 pieces of information. We can get almost all of those pieces from your last insurance contract, then ask can ask you just four extra questions through a chat interaction through whatsapp.”\n",
      "Marsh, a former VC at Index Ventures and the exited founder of onefinestay, says he came up with Nous after struggling to grapple with his household bills while down with Covid-19 during the pandemic and the simultaneous birth of his second child.\n",

      "Gushwork.ai, a global platform that aims to advance business process outsourcing (BPO) using AI and human expertise, has raised $2.1 million in a pre-seed funding round led by Lightspeed. B Capital, Sparrow Capital, Seaborne Capital and Beenext also participated in backing the startup that launched in April this year.\n",
      "In recent years, companies have invested considerable amounts of money in hiring skilled professionals to oversee their operational processes, such as administration, HR, payroll management or customer support. An increasing alternative to in-house hiring is to engage with staffing agencies or BPOs to outsource operations or to use platforms, such as Upwork or Fiverr to find freelancers who can handle process-oriented tasks. However, this has become a significant cost factor due to ongoing inflation. Gushwork.ai strives to address this problem in the market using its AI-powered, cross-border platform.\n",
      "The startup provides a curated marketplace that features offshore workers trained in using various AI applications to help businesses carry out their processes efficiently. It lets entrepreneurs outsource their tedious workflows and focus only on strategically important tasks.\n",
      "Nayrhit Bhattacharya, co-founder and CEO of Gushwork.ai, calls the process “uberizing the employee workforce,” as businesses can hire talent from different markets for their manually driven operational functions on a part-time basis. He co-founded Gushwork.ai with Adithya Venkatesh (CPO) in January with a usage-based pricing model.\n",
      "“Businesses don’t need to hire full-time,” Bhattacharya told TechCrunch in an interview. “They can use somebody for a few hours — three hours this week, 40 hours next week — and then not use it for another week.”\n",
      "Alongside offering part-time access to offshore talent, Gushwork.ai trains and equips its workforce with AI tools to make them fit for many workflows that were previously considered creative and not merely process-oriented to a large extent. These can be generating photorealistic blog designs, converting webinars to blogs, generating images for blog writing, writing blog posts on different topics or even doing search engine optimization. Generative AI tools have enabled large workforces to perform such creative tasks without requiring special skills.\n",
      "“You don’t need a 3D graphic designer per se, or you don’t need to spend three months trying to find the right 3D graphic designer or the photorealistic image copy generator on Upwork or Fiverr,” Bhattacharya noted.\n",
      "Gushwork.ai has trained its AI-augmented workforce to perform tasks, such as lead prospecting, email marketing, ad management, lead engagement on social media platforms, webinar moderation and marketing, social media management, responding to inbound leads, CRM setup, social media analytics data scraping, prospect outreach and ad campaign management, among others. These are all initially aimed at easing sales and marketing operations workflows. However, the startup also plans to expand into more specialized roles in the future.\n",
      "Within the first three months of operation, Gushwork.ai saw more than 50 businesses adopting its platform to delegate over 200 complex workflows. Bhattacharya told TechCrunch that around 80% of its customers use the platform on an active basis every week, while almost 90% of them use it every month.\n",
      "The startup has its key outbound focus on small and medium businesses and bootstrapped startups in the U.S. and Canada that have a team size of two to 20-30 members. Bhattacharya said that as much as 80% of its current customer base comprises small and medium businesses.\n",
      "While developed economies are the dominating markets for Gushwork.ai, Bhattacharya said it saw nearly 20% of its customers from India as well. The startup also considers India and the Philippines the initial supply bases for its offshore talent, though it looks to set up its workforce base across different countries over time.\n",
      "“The era of remote work has unlocked a number of new job opportunities and workflows that can be executed from anywhere in the world. This transcends beyond the traditional IT services or BPO industry. Gushwork.ai is leveraging this tailwind of cross-border cost arbitrage and is building a unique platform for businesses to delegate some of their most complex workflows to an elite on-demand offshore workforce trained on AI tools and apps. We are excited to partner with the team as they innovate and revitalize the future of outsourcing with AI,” said Lightspeed partner Rahul Taneja in a prepared statement.\n",
      "In the next few months, Gushwork.ai plans to utilize the fresh funds to enhance quality control and data security and privacy. It also looks to build features to help businesses create and document their complex processes within Gushwork.ai’s platform and use them as large training datasets to automate a list of workflows. Further, it plans to invest some capital in content-led organic market and personal building channels to reach new customers.\n",
      "The startup currently has over 25 full-time and part-time employees spread across three countries, with Bhattacharya based in Brooklyn and three founding members and co-founder Venkatesh in India’s Bengaluru.\n",

      "The startup has now raised $1.5M in pre-seed funding from Dig Ventures, founded by Ross Mason who created the Mule Project and founded MuleSoft (MULE:NYSE). Joining the round are AI and enterprise founders from companies such as Huggingface, Instana, Miro, and Matillion.\n",
      "CEO Matthaus Krzykowski told me via email: “Most of the GPT-4 apps that are showcased in the media are demoware. Users that try them abandon them quickly. Other AI tooling where VCs recently have been piling on a lot of money (vector databases / frameworks) have a lot of similar challenges.”\n",
      "He says dlt now has a growing community of Python developers and is being “deployed in production in several scale-up tech companies” including San Francisco-based software delivery company Harness, which we previously covered.\n",
      "In a statement, Alexander Butler, Senior Data Engineer at Harness said: “Leveraging dlt has changed our data operations. It has… accelerated the pace of our DataOps team: we spend less time on the EL (extract and load) and more on the T whilst still being able to deeply customise our extractors as business requirements evolve.”\n",
      "Julien Chaumond, CTO/Co-founder at Huggingface and an angel investor at dltHub added: “The current machine learning revolution has been enabled by the Cambrian explosion of Python open-source tools that have become so accessible that a wide range of practitioners can use them. As a simple-to-use Python library, dlt is the first tool that this new wave of people can use.”\n",
      "In regards to potential competitors Krzykowski admits that the startups “competes with ETL companies such Meltano, Stitch Data, Airbyte and to a lesser degree Fivetran.”\n",

Founded in 2019, the startup is led by Tang Jie, a professor in the university’s Department of Computer Science and Technology.\n",
      "Zhipu recently open-sourced its bilingual (Chinese and English) conversational AI model ChatGLM-6B, which is trained on six billion parameters and claims to be able to carry out inferences on a single consumer-grade graphics card, significantly lowering the cost of running an LLM. It also previously open-sourced a more robust, general-purpose variant, the GLM-130B trained on 130 billion parameters. Its user-facing chatbot app ChatGLM is currently in a close beta phase. first targeted at academic and industry players.\n",
      "Meituan’s investment came at a curious time. Just three weeks ago, the Chinese internet giant announced it would be acquiring Light Years Beyond, another prominent LLM player in China, for a hefty $234 million, despite the startup’s inception only four months prior. The change in ownership came after Light Years Beyond’s founder, Wang Huiwen, who’s also the billionaire co-founder of Meituan, announced his resignation from all corporate roles at the food delivery giant due to health reasons.\n",
      "These investments are expected to give Meituan’s AI capabilities a big talent boost. In turn, the AI firms stand to gain by potentially tapping Meituan’s vast reach of 450 million users ordering food, buying groceries, or booking hotels with the on-demand platform.\n",

      "Farizon is also hoping to establish a presence in Asia-Pacific, South America and the Middle East. Many Chinese EV-makers have begun to pursue strategies in the Middle East after being unable to compete meaningfully in Europe with Western brands.\n",
      "For the moment, the majority of Farizon’s sales come from China. The company sold about 37,800 light commercial vehicles in China in 2022, according to consultant group LMC Automotive. Between January and May 2023, Farizon sold 24,760 vehicles. By the end of the year, Farizon has said it hopes to reach 150,000 units sold.

      "The seed money will also enable Maka to continue R&D for its in-house development of EVs, which started last year, as well as to build its factory in West Java, starting later in 2023.\n",
      "AC Ventures, Korea’s SV Investment and East Ventures co-led the latest capital. Other investors in the round include Northstar Group, Provident, Alfa Crop, Skystar Capital, Peak XV Partners (formerly known as Sequoia India and SEA), Openspace Ventures, Shinhan Venture Investment, Beenext, Kinesys and M Venture Partners (MVP).\n",
      "Maka Motors CEO Raditya Wibowo and CTO Arief Fadillah, who previously worked at Gojek, founded Maka in 2021 to accelerate electric motorcycle adoption in Indonesia.\n",
      "“Like many Indonesians, we, founders, have been motorcycle users since a young age and we have also worked extensively with ride-hailing drivers at Gojek since 2015,” Wibowo said in an email interview with TechCrunch. “Indonesia is the world’s third-largest market for powered two-wheeled [vehicles], but EV penetration is still relatively low.”\n",
      "The startup says existing players in Indonesia, with only a fleet of 43,000 registered electric motorcycles, have not fully met the country’s goal, which aims to produce 600,000 electric vehicles by 2030. Indonesia has more than 127 million motorbikes, most of which work on gasoline.\n",
      "“Many current two-wheeled EV products are imported as Completely Knocked Down (CKD) kits from China and are designed for the needs of users in China,” the CEO said. “These 2W [two-wheel] vehicles designed in China, though relatively affordable, are not yet able to replace the gasoline motorcycles most Indonesian users use today.”\n",
      "In Indonesia, 2W vehicles require enough power to overtake cars as riders share the same lane as cars, the average travel distances are longer (than in China), and it is common to carry adult passengers, unlike China. Another pain point is cost, Wibowo said. Most 2W EV products with larger batteries and more motor power are more expensive than a gasoline bike.\n",
      "Maka’s mission is to build the best electric motorcycle, which can benefit Indonesian users to save money on gas. The two-year-old startup says it wants to offer a blend of driving range, power, usability, and durability at a competitive price compared to current bikes for Indonesian riders.\n",

      "Having worked in the food industry for several years, Shirley Chen saw firsthand the challenges of managing staffing and training for restaurant expansion. So when she met her future co-founders, she saw an opportunity to leverage their expertise in chemistry and electrical and electronic engineering, along with her own food and beverage background, to start a robotics company that could automate and standardize cooking for chain restaurants.\n",
      "In 2021, Chen co-founded Botinkit in Shenzhen and soon took the startup’s cooking robots beyond its home base to markets including Japan and the U.S. Off the back of its steady expansion, Botinkit announced today that it has raised $13 million in a Series A round that will partly be used for its expansion in the Middle East and Europe next year.\n",
      "Forebright led the round, with investors including 5Y Capital and Brizan Venture participating. With this latest financial injection, Botinkit has amassed nearly $20 million in funding thus far.\n",
      "Perhaps the most notable investor from the round is Zexiang Li, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology known for his angel investment in the drone giant DJI. HKUST, where Chen studied, has emerged as a hub for hardware innovation, with students turning their academic research into commercial ideas.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Li and his investment partner Gao Bingqiang, also an HKUST professor, have been supporting their students with funding and other resources. Gao is also an investor in Botinkit.\n",
      "Scaling restaurants with robots\n",
      "While Botinkit sees California-based Miso Robotics as a potential competitor, the companies are augmenting different sets of cooking skills.\n",
      "Miso’s burger-flipping robots have helped it ink deals with chain giants like Jack in the Box and White Castle. Meanwhile, Botinkit’s wok-shaped robot specializes in stir-frying and stewing and includes an add-on arm that can take over humans in adding ingredients. The company is currently developing a deep-fry model, set to make its debut next year.\n",
      "Automation, Botinkit claims, helps cut ingredient loss by 30% and energy by 40% when compared to commercial gas stoves. But another key selling point of its robots is their ability to facilitate restaurants’ cross-regional expansion, Chen said in an interview with TechCrunch.\n",
      "One of the major hurdles that restaurants encounter when expanding is finding and training a large number of staff, which can slow down their growth. Even if they manage to recruit enough personnel, maintaining consistent quality control can be challenging in new markets.\n",
      "A typical 100-square-meter kitchen requires six to ten staff members, according to Chen, but with Botinkit’s robots, that headcount can be cut to just one or two. This means that a franchise restaurant with 500 locations could potentially reduce its kitchen staff from 5,000 to several hundreds.\n",
      "“Cuisine used to be restricted by time and geographical boundaries,” Chen suggested. “However, with the digitization of cooking, a range of new possibilities arise, including remote cooking. Suppose I’m in Shenzhen and you’re in the U.S., I can use our software and hardware system to ‘cook’ for you remotely. It’s an incredibly exciting prospect.”\n",
      "Botinkit’s current robots come with temperature sensors, but the startup is allocating a portion of its new funding towards developing multi-modal sensors that can also detect flavors and smells. The ultimate goal, Chen said, is to leverage artificial general intelligence, or AGI, so its robots can understand human preferences and refine cooking processes based on data feedback.\n",
      "While the majority of Botinkit’s revenue comes from selling hardware, the company has started generating income by creating custom recipes for its clients through its global network of partnered chefs. Its clients range from fast-food chains and hotels to catering services and supermarkets. In China, its robots have been cooking at food stalls inside Walmart and Delibowl.\n",

If other automakers were to adopt FSD technology, they would need to onboard both Tesla’s software and hardware suite.

      "During Wednesday’s second quarter earnings call, Musk also said Tesla will allow the transfer of FSD software to new vehicles, but only in the third quarter.\n",
      "“This is a one-time amnesty,” said Musk, encouraging buyers to place their orders in Q3 or “within reasonable delivery time frames.” Currently, Tesla owners who have spent the $15,000 on FSD are locked into their existing car, and cannot upgrade to a new model without losing their access to the software.\n",
      "Today, about 400,000 Teslas have FSD onboard, according to Tesla’s fourth-quarter earnings report. The automaker’s goal in expanding the number of cars that use the controversial software is a pure play at increasing the amount of data those cars collect of real-world driving environments.\n",
      "Musk touched on the importance of having vast amounts of video data to train FSD in order to eventually achieve full autonomy. Today, the automaker has accumulated 300 million miles driven in FSD, a number that Musk said “will seem extremely small very soon.”\n",
      "Tesla to invest $1 billion in Dojo supercomputer\n",
      "The other main piece of Tesla’s reach for autonomy is having enough compute power.\n",
      "“The fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training,” said Musk. “If we had more training compute, we could get it done faster.”\n",
      "Tesla also announced Wednesday that it would soon start production of its Dojo training computer. What that means, exactly, is unclear. Dojo, which Tesla announced at its AI Day in 2021, will be used to train Tesla’s neural nets. Those neural nets are used to power, train and improve FSD, as well as the automaker’s humanoid robot, Optimus. Musk said Tesla would be spending well over $1 billion on Dojo across capital expenditures and R&D.\n",
      "The automaker is already using a large Nvidia GPU-based supercomputer, but the new Dojo is custom-built using chips designed by Tesla. Musk has claimed that Dojo will be capable of an exaflop, or 1 quintillion floating-point operations, per second. Per a graph in Tesla’s earnings report, it appears the automaker is now promising Dojo will deliver 100 exaflops by October 2024. A supercomputer capable of that kind of compute could perform in one second what a regular desktop computer might take billions of years to compute.\n",
      "These are some seriously bold claims that should be taken with a grain of salt. Tesla needs Dojo to perform well so that it can fulfill its promises of bringing full autonomy to the masses. Previously, Musk has said that without FSD, Tesla would be “worth zero.” That’s because without the hype and potential of FSD actually turning Teslas into autonomous vehicles that can be hired out as robotaxis, Tesla is really just an automaker.\n",
      "Musk has repeatedly promised that Tesla would achieve full autonomy by such-and-such date, and has repeatedly passed those dates with a partially autonomous product. Musk acknowledged this faux pas Wednesday, saying that people have “quite fairly” made fun of him and his over-optimistic predictions.\n",
      "“I know I’m the Boy Who Cried FSD, but I think it will be better than a human by the end of this year,” he said.\n",
      "This statement comes amid continued scrutiny from regulators into Tesla over the safety of FSD and its other ADAS, Autopilot. The latter has been linked to several crashes, many of which were fatal.\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/beijing-robotics-firm-forwardxs-series-c-hits-61-million/\n",
      "ForwardX this week announced an additional $30 million in funding, bringing the Beijing-based firm’s Series C up to $61 million. The funding follows an initial tranche announced way back in December 2021. It brings the warehouse robotics firm’s total funding up to $140 million since its 2016 launch.\n",
      "The last few years have been a good time to be running an autonomous mobile robotics (AMR) company, of course. The early days kicked things into overdrive for companies looking to automate, and the venture capital has followed suit. Even after most geographies have reopened, plenty of factors have continued to drive adoption from the supply chain crunch to labor shortages.\n",
      "“Our success in securing this funding reflects the positive momentum we have built over the past few years,” CEO Nicolas Chee said in a release. “ForwardX Robotics has experienced substantial growth across key markets, and we are excited to expand our footprint globally.\n",
      "For its part, ForwardX already boasts an impressive client list, including L’Oréal, IKEA, SF DHL, UNIQLO, Walmart and Mitsubishi. Those are the sorts of names that keep VCs interested. All told, the company says it’s deployed some 3,000 robots across 150 sites on four continents. Presently it’s seeking further expansion into the North American, European, Asian and Australian markets.\n",
      "Warehouse, logistics and manufacturing are the primary targets for the company’s ARMs. Unlike much of the competition — which has drilled down on perfecting a single task — ForwardX has been quick to diversify its robot portfolio, with systems that transport, store, pick and dock. Those are maintained by a proprietary fleet management software. It’s effectively a brownfield solution for companies that are looking to automate several steps of the process with robots that can work in concert with one another.\n",
      "There are a lot of different approaches in the space currently. There’s still surprisingly limited penetration of automated systems into warehouses, so there’s a lot of space for a number of different solutions to thrive.\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/snowstorm/\n",
      "Created to ensure open and free access to the internet, Snowflake saw a huge uptick in users during the start of the Ukraine War — and has grown even more since then. Started as an open source project by Serene (who goes by her first name only for privacy reasons), Snowflake, which began as a pluggable transport for Tor, has had a makeover into Snowstorm, and now promises faster connections and can run as standalone software outside of Tor. Snowstorm’s open beta will launch this quarter.\n",
      "Snowstorm announced today it has raised $3 million in seed funding, led by Seed Club Ventures, with participation from Cabrit Capital, Keppel Capital, EchoVC and Matt Devost.\n",
      "Snowflake started as an open source project eight years ago to keep the internet free. Serene taught herself how to code when she was nine and was hired by Google while still a teenager. She ended up being the first engineer at Google Ideas, now known as Google Jigsaw, and used her time there to find ways to use large-scale infrastructure to help the internet.\n",
      "Part of Serene’s interest in keeping the internet free is that her childhood was difficult and the internet was a refuge for her. “I also knew that the internet would not say the same, especially as things have changed in the last couple of decades and censorship has certainly escalated,” she said. Serene left Google as a top expert on WebRTC, an open source project that adds real-time communication to web browsers and mobile apps. She saw that it would be useful for a new kind of decentralized tool that could keep the internet free. So she prototyped Snowflake and integrated it into the Tor browser.\n",
      "“Basically, at the end of the day when you connect to the internet, you’re connecting to other computers. Your ISP, your internet service provider is also computers that connect to the rest of the internet that you connect through to connect to the rest of the internet. And if people have issues with their ISP or they want privacy, usually traditional VPNs are someone’s computer before you connect to the rest of the internet,” she explained, which means VPNs can be monitored and easily circumvented.\n",
      "Snowflake, on the other hand, is decentralized and is deployed as a pluggable transport for Tor. Instead of trusting a centralized system or a VPN that can be blocked, it consists of about 100,000 people, from all over the world, temporarily stepping up to use their computers to act as brokers, disguised by domain fronting, so it seems as if it comes from a non-restricted service. Users and brokers are connected by WebRTC. “It’s basically a two-sided user base,” Serene said. “There’s people who need help connecting to the internet and people who can help other connect to the internet.”\n",
      "Millions of sessions are being established every day, with things kicking off last year during the start of the Ukraine war when users needed to circumvent internet censorship.\n",
      "Snowstorm is an upgrade on all levels, Serene said. She rewrote Snowflake in Rust, partly to help the speed and partly to help it become cross-platform and system wide. One of the challenges with Snowflake was that it had a lot more usage than expected and ran into bottlenecks. “The project itself is a lot of interesting, brilliant people coming together to make this happen. And I just happen to be the initial creator of this project, have an understanding of the architecture and where to go.” So when Snowflake ran into bottlenecks, Serene made improvements — for example, Snowstorm can run system wide and is fast enough to stream videos.\n",
      "Serene will continue to build Snowstorm using its new funding, but she said she doesn’t want to participate in marketing strategies like YouTube ads. “I would rather focus on building the real thing that actually works and less resources with a small amount of resources that I’ve been able to raise with Snowstorm.”\n",
      "Serene is also a prolific concert pianist, focusing on music after leaving Google. She is going to Europe this month to play Rachmaninoff Concerto No. 2 and is endorsed by Bösendorfer. the Austrian piano manufacturer.\n",
      "“In a funny way, being a musician has enabled me to be a better technologist, and being a technologist has enabled me to be a better musician. I find that they are very connected. Music gives me the energy to do everything that needs to be done.” Serene added that during fundraising, some investors asked how she’s able to run a company with her music career. “My answer is that it is some combination of when someone is exercising every morning to stay healthy. Do you tell them, how can you have time? So I happen to play concerts and it makes me very healthy and it’s a lot of energy.”\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/why-does-the-internet-love-tree-law-so-much/\n",
      "It was day 76 of the Hollywood writers’ strike, and once again, comedian Chris Stephens journeyed out to the picket line. But when he arrived in front of Universal Studios, he noticed something odd. The trees outside the studio — which offer a rare bit of shade from the brutal Los Angeles sun — had been trimmed until they were almost bare.\n",
      "Quick shoutout to the good people at @UniversalPics for trimming the trees that gave our picket line shade right before a 90+ degree week. pic.twitter.com/aZvvPYQ23i — Chris Stephens (@ChrisStephensMD) July 17, 2023\n",
      "“Quick shout out to the good people at @UniversalPics for trimming the trees that gave our picket line shade right before a 90+ degree week,” Stephens tweeted.\n",
      "It’s a historic moment in Hollywood, because as of last week, the actors’ and writers’ unions have joined together for the first dual strike since 1960. Though it’s not proven for sure that Universal is responsible, the timing seemed uncanny to the striking entertainers.\n",
      "“Obviously, I can’t say that there’s a bunch of people smoking cigars in a room saying like, ‘Oh, let’s get them all burned to a crisp on the sidewalk,'” Stephens told TechCrunch. “But the moment everyone on the picket line saw those trees had been trimmed, it felt deliberate.”\n",
      "Universal did not respond to request for comment.\n",
      "Stephens’ tweet went viral — partially because it’s ridiculous to imagine that a massive studio might have trimmed trees in an act of union busting, but also, because as it turns out, there’s a dedicated corner of the internet that obsesses over tree law.\n",
      "Tree law is what it sounds like: law about trees. There’s a Reddit community, r/treelaw, that has more than 77,000 members. Not everyone is an expert in hyperspecific local tree laws. They just find this esoteric branch of law to be neat, especially when it crops up in extraordinarily specific and bizarre scenarios.\n",
      "One of Reddit’s most popular communities is r/AmITheAsshole (also known as AITA), where people share the drama happening in their personal lives and ask Redditors to litigate who in the situation is the asshole. Tree law scratches the same itch as AITA, but it’s weirder, because any situation in which trees are involved in a lawsuit is probably a bit more niche than a story about a bad breakup.\n",
      "It’s strange how often tree law comes up online, and something of a fandom has formed around it. As writer Jenna Routenberg explained, “I think the underpinning of the meme is that the story is usually some rich asshole does harm to trees for their own convenience/aesthetics/property value, and some plucky lawyer nails them on an obscure statute, and they get fined like mad.”\n",
      "That seems to be the case in one ongoing dispute, in which a New Jersey homeowner cut down 32 trees on a neighbor’s property, apparently to get a better view of New York City, but according to tree law, there is a $1,000 fine for each tree cut down without a permit. Twitter user @SamAsIAm posted about the incident, which he heard about from a friend who is a municipal arborist. The arborist found that there is a provision requiring the mature trees to be replanted, but the area where the trees were chopped down is on a mountainside that’s inaccessible by car, so now, the property owner who cut down the trees could be on the hook for paying to build a road and replant the trees. And since these trees were so old, they will be very difficult and costly to replace.\n",
      "To rephrase it as an AITA post: am I the asshole if I cut down 32 trees on my neighbor’s property, but instead of just charging me a $32,000 fine, now they’re going to make me build a road and find transplanted, equally mature trees to replant?\n",
      "Like the situation at Universal, this incident went viral, and when a preliminary hearing took place in June, 200 people tried to join the public Zoom call.\n",
      "Naturally, the combination of large corporations (allegedly) behaving badly and tree law created a perfect storm for internet virality. Stephens’ tweet even got noticed by the Los Angeles city controller, Kenneth Mejia, who investigated the situation.\n",
      "UPDATE: With cooperation from the Bureau of Street Services, we have found that no tree trimming permits have been issued over the last three years for this location outside Universal Studios. Also, the City did not issue any tree trimming permits for the latest tree trimmings. https://t.co/8ge7LElRao pic.twitter.com/JChoiNvHhW — LA City Controller Kenneth Mejia (@lacontroller) July 19, 2023\n",
      "After consulting with the Bureau of Street Services, Mejia found that the city didn’t issue any permits to allow these tree trimmings, nor had any permits been issued in the last three years. Whoever is held responsible for this unbeleafable behavior will be charged an administrative fee starting at $250, but Stephens says it’s not about the money. When incidents like this go viral amid the writers’ and actors’ strikes, it can help turn the public narrative against studios. That’s an asset that writers didn’t have in 2008, when TikTok didn’t exist and Twitter was two years old.\n",
      "“What [studios] can’t afford, but is priceless, is outrage,” he said. “These are the people that watch their shows and subscribe to their streaming services. They clearly care when people are upset.”\n",
      "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/ripple-xrp-court-ruling/\n",
      "Last week, the crypto community celebrated a U.S. federal court case that ruled Ripple’s XRP token does not make up illegal securities sales — but only in some cases.\n",
      "Though many celebrated the ruling, it’s not a true win for crypto.\n",
      "Judge Analisa Torres, who presided over the case, approved the SEC’s motion with regard to institutional sales of Ripple’s XRP token, meaning that the cryptocurrency is a security when used for institutional sales. However, Torres denied the SEC’s motion related to programmatic sales of XRP, among other circumstances, which means she ruled XRP is not a security when sold to the broader public.\n",
      "“Lining up the summary judgment in favor of the SEC next to the summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, it is as if two separate law clerks wrote the different sections and the judge never reconciled them,” Benjamin Cole, fellow at the British Blockchain Association and professor at Fordham University’s Gabelli School of Business, told TechCrunch+. “If this were an assignment turned in by a student, I would dock the grade repeatedly for internal inconsistencies and specious conclusions.”\n",
      "“[The ruling] underscores the need for regulatory clarity and consistent standards across different types of participants and transactions,” said David Shargel, partner at Bracewell LLP. “The distinction will continue to fuel questions about the legalities and regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency sales and distribution.”\n",
      "And it is, indeed, confusing: It’s a security in one context but not the other, which means it backs the SEC’s stance but also goes against it.\n"
