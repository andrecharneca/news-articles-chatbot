    "text": "Last week, the crypto community celebrated a U.S. federal court case that ruled Ripple\u2019s XRP token does not make up illegal securities sales \u2014 but only in some cases.\nThough many celebrated the ruling, it\u2019s not a true win for crypto.\nJudge Analisa Torres, who presided over the case, approved the SEC\u2019s motion with regard to institutional sales of Ripple\u2019s XRP token, meaning that the cryptocurrency is a security when used for institutional sales. However, Torres denied the SEC\u2019s motion related to programmatic sales of XRP, among other circumstances, which means she ruled XRP is not a security when sold to the broader public.\n\u201cLining up the summary judgment in favor of the SEC next to the summary judgment in favor of Ripple Labs, it is as if two separate law clerks wrote the different sections and the judge never reconciled them,\u201d Benjamin Cole, fellow at the British Blockchain Association and professor at Fordham University\u2019s Gabelli School of Business, told TechCrunch+. \u201cIf this were an assignment turned in by a student, I would dock the grade repeatedly for internal inconsistencies and specious conclusions.\u201d\n\u201c[The ruling] underscores the need for regulatory clarity and consistent standards across different types of participants and transactions,\u201d said David Shargel, partner at Bracewell LLP. \u201cThe distinction will continue to fuel questions about the legalities and regulatory frameworks surrounding cryptocurrency sales and distribution.\u201d\nAnd it is, indeed, confusing: It\u2019s a security in one context but not the other, which means it backs the SEC\u2019s stance but also goes against it.",
