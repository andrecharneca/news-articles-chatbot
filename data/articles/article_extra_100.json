    "title": "Beijing robotics firm ForwardX\u2019s Series C hits $61 million",
    "text": "ForwardX this week announced an additional $30 million in funding, bringing the Beijing-based firm\u2019s Series C up to $61 million. The funding follows an initial tranche announced way back in December 2021. It brings the warehouse robotics firm\u2019s total funding up to $140 million since its 2016 launch.\nThe last few years have been a good time to be running an autonomous mobile robotics (AMR) company, of course. The early days kicked things into overdrive for companies looking to automate, and the venture capital has followed suit. Even after most geographies have reopened, plenty of factors have continued to drive adoption from the supply chain crunch to labor shortages.\n\u201cOur success in securing this funding reflects the positive momentum we have built over the past few years,\u201d CEO Nicolas Chee said in a release. \u201cForwardX Robotics has experienced substantial growth across key markets, and we are excited to expand our footprint globally.\nFor its part, ForwardX already boasts an impressive client list, including L\u2019Or\u00e9al, IKEA, SF DHL, UNIQLO, Walmart and Mitsubishi. Those are the sorts of names that keep VCs interested. All told, the company says it\u2019s deployed some 3,000 robots across 150 sites on four continents. Presently it\u2019s seeking further expansion into the North American, European, Asian and Australian markets.\nWarehouse, logistics and manufacturing are the primary targets for the company\u2019s ARMs. Unlike much of the competition \u2014 which has drilled down on perfecting a single task \u2014 ForwardX has been quick to diversify its robot portfolio, with systems that transport, store, pick and dock. Those are maintained by a proprietary fleet management software. It\u2019s effectively a brownfield solution for companies that are looking to automate several steps of the process with robots that can work in concert with one another.\nThere are a lot of different approaches in the space currently. There\u2019s still surprisingly limited penetration of automated systems into warehouses, so there\u2019s a lot of space for a number of different solutions to thrive.",
