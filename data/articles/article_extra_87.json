    "title": "Tesla hits $25B in Q2 revenue, but margins decrease amid price cuts",
    "text": "Tesla reported Wednesday net income of $2.7 billion in the second quarter, up 20% from the same period last year as once again, the company\u2019s EV price cuts dug into profits. The automaker has repeatedly reduced the cost of its four EV models in the United States, Mexico, Europe and China. The move helped boost sales in the first half of the year, with Tesla hitting record Q2 deliveries of 466,140 units. But it\u2019s also taken chunks out of Tesla\u2019s normally healthy automotive margins.\nFor the second time this year, Tesla\u2019s gross margins decreased to 18.2%, down from 25% in Q2 2022 and down from 19.3% last quarter.\nTesla matched Wall Street revenue estimates of around $25 billion for the quarter, which is nearly 50% higher than year-ago sales of $16.9 billion. Most of the revenue came from Tesla\u2019s automotive revenue, which hit $21.3 billion in Q2. That number includes $282 million from federal tax incentives.\nA small, but notable, chunk of Tesla\u2019s Q2 revenue came from \u201cservices and other revenue,\u201d which usually includes after-sales vehicle services and parts, retail merchandise, vehicle insurance and the Supercharger network.\nTesla\u2019s number of Supercharger stations and connectors increased 33% in the second quarter to 5,265 and 48,082, respectively. The automaker has been opening its network of Superchargers to other automakers in recent months, notably Ford and General Motors, and most recently Nissan. While charging isn\u2019t a main revenue driver for Tesla, it\u2019s possible that some of the increase came from Tesla opening up its charging network.\nEnergy generation and storage revenue remained flat quarter-over-quarter, but grew 74% year-over-year.\nTesla\u2019s operating margin dropped slightly from 11.4% in Q1 to 9.6% in Q2. Its capital expenditures remained flat QoQ but increased 19% YoY. The company reported it spent $2 billion in capital expenditures, likely due to continued production ramping in the automaker\u2019s Berlin and Texas gigafactories. Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings show that Berlin\u2019s vehicle capacity increased by 25,000 units over Q1 reported numbers.\nTesla closed out the quarter with $1 billion in free cash flow, which is up from the $441 million with which it finished the first quarter.\nTesla stock closed at $291.26 Wednesday and dropped 5% in after-hours trading.\nTesla\u2019s 2023 outlook\nTesla\u2019s full-year outlook hasn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cFor 2023, we expect to remain ahead of the long-term 50% CAGR with around 1.8 million vehicles for the year,\u201d reads Tesla\u2019s earnings report.\nIn Q1, Tesla delivered 422,875 vehicles globally. In the second quarter, that number hit 466,140 units, a 10% increase. If Tesla\u2019s production and delivery capacity keeps increasing at around the same clip, the automaker will be able to reach close to 2 billion units by the end of the year.\nHowever, Musk did say Wednesday that Q3 production will decrease slightly, driven by planned downtime for factory upgrades. He noted that macroeconomic conditions are uncertain and could impact execution positively or negatively in the near term.\nMusk also defended Tesla\u2019s many price cuts, saying it was a move to combat the potential for lower sales amid economic uncertainty.\n\u201cWhen interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car,\u201d said Musk.\nThe executive noted that Tesla had also brought back its referral program in an effort to boost sales.\nCybertruck information still lacking\nTesla finally built its much-delayed Cybertruck over the weekend at Giga Austin, but few details were shared at the time. During Wednesday\u2019s earnings report, the company still left investors and analysts wanting more.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always very difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we\u2019ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year,\u201d said CEO Elon Musk Wednesday.\nMusk also noted that \u201cdemand is so far off the hook, you can\u2019t even see the hook,\u201d emphasizing that the Cybertruck has \u201ca lot of new technology\u2026so the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain.\u201d\nTesla didn\u2019t provide other information on the Cybertruck, like production capacity next year, pricing and more specs.\nThis story has been updated with information from Tesla\u2019s Q2 earnings call.",
