The company is also recruiting for 450 jobs across its 11 regional distribution centres.\nAldi and Lidl, another German discount retailer, reported double-digit sales growth for the Christmas period on strong demand for their low-price products during a cost-of-living crisis.\nPrivately-owned Aldi, which has over 990 stores and 40,000 employees in Britain, last year overtook Morrisons to become Britain's fourth-largest supermarket chain.\nAldi, which says it opened the world's first discount grocery store, and Lidl have grown rapidly over the last decade, chipping away at the market share held by established supermarkets Tesco (TSCO.L), Sainsbury's (SBRY.L), Asda and Morrisons.\nThat has helped the duo to continue expanding even as costs surge.\nReporting by Muvija M; Editing by Kate Holton\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "date": "2023-02-16 00:00:00"}
