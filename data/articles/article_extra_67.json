    "text": "July 12 (Reuters) - Gerry and Elizabeth Paulus love taking road trips across the United States, and soon they\u2019ll be preparing for what they call their \"ultimate road trip\" - one that will take them into deep space.\nThe couple from Mesa, Arizona, will be sending their DNA into space in the upcoming Enterprise mission being launched by Celestis, a space burials company based out of Houston, Texas.\n\u201cIt helps us to think about the future and even though we're not going to be there physically, we're going to be a little part of it in some way and that really does make me smile,\u201d Elizabeth Paulus said.\n[1/3]Gerry Paulus holds a DNA Memorial Kit given to families by Celestis, inc. as a keepsake for those who use their space burials service, in Mesa, Arizona, U.S., June 26, 2023.

Kennedy will also be represented.\n\"That repository is going to be 330 million kilometers out into space,\" Celestis President Colby Youngblood said. \"It's going to be the first ... repository of our civilization out in the universe.\"\nReporting by Liliana Salgado and Evan Garc\u00eda; Writing by Mark Porter\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",
