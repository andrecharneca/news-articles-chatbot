IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, said on Wednesday its annual carbon emissions fell 5% in the last fiscal year following efforts to boost renewable energy use and make its products more energy efficient.\nIKEA has a target to be climate positive - reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits - by 2030.\nIt said emissions in the entire value chain - from raw material production to customers' use and disposal of products - was estimated to total 25.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the 12 months through August 2022, against an upwardly revised 27.2 million tonnes in the 2021 fiscal year.\nOne of the main drivers of the reduction was the development of a more energy efficient LED bulb range called \"Solhetta\", said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive of the Inter IKEA Group that owns the IKEA brand.\nHelping suppliers to use more renewable energy in countries such as China - by getting them discounted loans and framework agreements to increase their access to clean power - also contributed to the emissions cut, he told Reuters.\nInter IKEA acts as franchisor to IKEA store owners and is in charge of supply.\nAbrahamsson Ring said earlier that retail sales volumes did not increase in fiscal year 2022 as IKEA struggled to meet demand due to supply shortages.

While sales of Microsoft's Xbox consoles are slowing down, the company has been drawing on its cash pile to expand the collection of games it can sell and allow people to play through its cloud data centers.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith said at a press conference that, effective immediately, its Xbox games will be available on Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud games service. Smith said if the Activision deal closes, it will bring all Activision Blizzard titles to GeForce Now.\nNvidia is now on board with Microsoft's pending deal for regulatory purposes, the two companies said in a joint statement confirming the two companies 10-year deal. In January Bloomberg reported that Nvidia had gone to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission with complaints about the Activision deal.\n\"Combining the incredibly rich catalog of Xbox first party games with GeForce Now's high-performance streaming capabilities will propel cloud gaming into a mainstream offering that appeals to gamers at all levels of interest and experience,\" Jeff Fisher, Nvidia's senior vice president for GeForce, was quoted as saying. \"Through this partnership, more of the world's most popular titles will now be available from the cloud with just a click, playable by millions more gamers.\"\nMicrosoft proposed its Activision Blizzard acquisition in January 2022, but since then, the buyer has faced pushback", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1939, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "62a46dd8-3d10-46cc-bc1c-cbd24a3384f4": {"__data__": {"id_": "62a46dd8-3d10-46cc-bc1c-cbd24a3384f4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Nvidia supports Microsoft, Activision merger after Xbox deal to add games to cloud service", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html", "date": "2023-02-21 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1ce4e087-9b08-489d-801d-dd7aced834d7", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Nvidia supports Microsoft, Activision merger after Xbox deal to add games to cloud service", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/21/microsoft-will-bring-xbox-games-to-nvidias-cloud-gaming-service.html", "date": "2023-02-21 00:00:00"}, "hash": "8f1a8d3686b3932804945bb829ed3dc5b4ca6e6673039cdd969b1e6b3000f466"}}, "hash": "ec6d07b433c08c59425a0b80a7233c6d144335fdffecf64a4b70e0620af3a492", "text": "Blizzard acquisition in January 2022, but since then, the buyer has faced pushback from regulators in the U.S., European Union and U.K.\nThe Nvidia arrangement is meaningful because \"now we're addressing the full range of issues that have been raised by regulators as topics of not just interest but in some cases concern,\" Smith said at the press conference.\nIn November, the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, opened an in-depth investigation into the deal citing concerns that it could reduce competition in the video games market.\nActivision Blizzard is the company behind popular game franchise Call of Duty. The EU commission said last year it is concerned that Microsoft could block access to the game on other platforms if the deal goes through.\nThe commission is also concerned that it could give Microsoft an unfair edge in the nascent area of cloud gaming. Microsoft has a service called Game Pass through which it charges gamers $9.99 per month to access a library of games. The Activision takeover would add some high-profile titles to Game Pass.\nNvidia's GeForce Now has over 25 million members, while Microsoft said last year that 25 million people subscribe to Game Pass. Nvidia offers free and paid GeForce Now tiers, although high resolution is only available to those who pay. Members of GeForce Now will be able to stream through the cloud the games they buy through Microsoft's app store, along with games listed in Epic Games and Steam's app stores.\nIn December, Microsoft said it had \"entered into a 10-year commitment\" to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo when the Activision acquisition closes.

More speed is essential for functions like inference, encryption, decryption and processing.\nDDR5 increases density, which improves system size, weight and power (SWaP). It also brings memory at a lower voltage, which means less power lost to heat.\nCXL reduces the need for the CPU to be involved in PCIe transactions, making the CPU available for more data processing.\nCompute system security is enhanced with the addition of Total Memory Encryption (TME) and Trust Domain Extensions (TDX).

Eleventh-hour launch scrubs are fairly routine in the highly complex and risky endeavor of human spaceflight.\nHad Monday's launch been a success, it was expected to take the crew about 25 hours to reach their destination at the International Space Station (ISS), a laboratory orbiting about 250 miles (420 km)", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1728, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5160077c-962f-42c2-9657-b05a5166d265": {"__data__": {"id_": "5160077c-962f-42c2-9657-b05a5166d265", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "NASA, SpaceX postpone launch of next space station crew at 11th hour", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/nasa-spacex-postpone-launch-next-space-station-crew-2023-02-27/", "date": "2023-02-27 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ee72e414-38e3-4d72-b0fb-699556af5354", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "NASA, SpaceX postpone launch of next space station crew at 11th hour", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/nasa-spacex-postpone-launch-next-space-station-crew-2023-02-27/", "date": "2023-02-27 00:00:00"}, "hash": "d0fa551da1726fa7e2919424ffc543fa72b599dc9f5c4216970cfe71860d983d"}}, "hash": "7a2bddcc237fa81e9278e1a887ef20b724b5225685ddf4cebfabee77cf65a016", "text": "International Space Station (ISS), a laboratory orbiting about 250 miles (420 km) above Earth.\nDesignated Crew 6, the mission will carry the sixth long-duration ISS team that NASA has flown aboard SpaceX since Musk's California-based company began sending American astronauts to orbit in May 2020.\nThe latest ISS crew is led by mission commander Stephen Bowen, 59, a one-time U.S. Navy submarine officer who has logged more than 40 days in orbit as a veteran of three space shuttle flights and seven spacewalks.\nFellow NASA astronaut Warren \"Woody\" Hoburg, 37, an engineer and commercial aviator designated as the Crew 6 pilot, will be making his first spaceflight.\nThe Crew 6 mission also is notable for its inclusion of UAE astronaut Sultan Alneyadi, 41, only the second person from his country to fly to space and the first to launch from U.S. soil as part of a long-duration space station team.
