Snowstorm\u2019s open beta will launch this quarter.\nSnowstorm announced today it has raised $3 million in seed funding, led by Seed Club Ventures, with participation from Cabrit Capital, Keppel Capital, EchoVC and Matt Devost.\nSnowflake started as an open source project eight years ago to keep the internet free. Serene taught herself how to code when she was nine and was hired by Google while still a teenager. She ended up being the first engineer at Google Ideas, now known as Google Jigsaw, and used her time there to find ways to use large-scale infrastructure to help the internet.\nPart of Serene\u2019s interest in keeping the internet free is that her childhood was difficult and the internet was a refuge for her. \u201cI also knew that the internet would not say the same, especially as things have changed in the last couple of decades and censorship has certainly escalated,\u201d she said. Serene left Google as a top expert on WebRTC, an open source project that adds real-time communication to web browsers and mobile apps. She saw that it would be useful for a new kind of decentralized tool that could keep the internet free. So she prototyped Snowflake and integrated it into the Tor browser.\n\u201cBasically, at the end of the day when you connect to the internet, you\u2019re connecting to other computers.

Instead of trusting a centralized system or a VPN that can be blocked, it consists of about 100,000 people, from all over the world, temporarily stepping up to use their computers to act as brokers, disguised by domain fronting, so it seems as if it comes from a non-restricted service. Users and brokers are connected by WebRTC. \u201cIt\u2019s basically a two-sided user base,\u201d Serene said. \u201cThere\u2019s people who need help connecting to the internet and people who can help other connect to the internet.\u201d\nMillions of sessions are being established every day, with things kicking off last year during the start of the Ukraine war when users needed to circumvent internet censorship.\nSnowstorm is an upgrade on all levels, Serene said. She rewrote Snowflake in Rust, partly to help the speed and partly to help it become cross-platform and system wide. One of the challenges with Snowflake was that it had a lot more usage than expected and ran into bottlenecks. \u201cThe project itself is a lot of interesting, brilliant people coming together to make this happen. And I just happen to be the initial creator of this project, have an understanding of the architecture and where to go.\u201d So when Snowflake ran into bottlenecks, Serene made improvements \u2014 for example, Snowstorm can run system wide and is fast enough to stream videos.\nSerene will continue to build Snowstorm using its new funding, but she said she doesn\u2019t want", "start_char_idx": 1836, "end_char_idx": 3671, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "f29147e2-9760-4cd2-9cd6-3db7a0c5a03b": {"__data__": {"id_": "f29147e2-9760-4cd2-9cd6-3db7a0c5a03b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Snowstorm raises seed to keep the internet free", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/snowstorm/", "date": "2023-07-19 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3321fa5a-a05e-4b98-ae1c-c971dee86176", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Snowstorm raises seed to keep the internet free", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/19/snowstorm/", "date": "2023-07-19 00:00:00"}, "hash": "8c28485b8953653828564cdcef1dc27f827535d5d5ca4f11cd045edb4c62021c"}}, "hash": "73b79b1a51aefe5c49e5361566f9ef0aab446b9fee3f5cd5387441bae9006f15", "text": "will continue to build Snowstorm using its new funding, but she said she doesn\u2019t want to participate in marketing strategies like YouTube ads. \u201cI would rather focus on building the real thing that actually works and less resources with a small amount of resources that I\u2019ve been able to raise with Snowstorm.\u201d\nSerene is also a prolific concert pianist, focusing on music after leaving Google.

Tree law scratches the same itch as AITA, but it\u2019s weirder, because any situation in which trees are involved in a lawsuit is probably a bit more niche than a story about a bad breakup.\nIt\u2019s strange how often tree law comes up online, and something of a fandom has formed around it. As writer Jenna Routenberg explained, \u201cI think the underpinning of the meme is that the story is usually some rich asshole does harm to trees for their own convenience/aesthetics/property value, and some plucky lawyer nails them on an obscure statute, and they get fined like mad.\u201d\nThat seems to be the case in one ongoing dispute, in which a New Jersey homeowner cut down 32 trees on a neighbor\u2019s property, apparently to get a better view of New York City, but according to tree law, there is a $1,000 fine for each tree cut down without a permit.

Reuters could not ascertain whether any digital currency was ultimately stolen as a result of the hack.\nCybersecurity firm CrowdStrike Holdings, (CRWD.O) which is working with JumpCloud to investigate the breach, confirmed that \"Labyrinth Chollima\" - the name it gives to a particular squad of North Korean hackers - was behind the breach.\nCrowdStrike Senior Vice President for Intelligence Adam Meyers declined to comment on what the hackers were seeking, but noted that they had a history of targeting cryptocurrency targets.\n\"One of their primary objectives has been generating revenue for the regime,\" he said.\nPyongyang's", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1772, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "cdd54cf2-b425-4ef2-a126-8fdb367f3ca4": {"__data__": {"id_": "cdd54cf2-b425-4ef2-a126-8fdb367f3ca4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "North Korean hackers breached a US tech company to steal crypto", "url": "https://reuters.com/technology/n-korea-hackers-breached-us-it-company-bid-steal-crypto-sources-2023-07-20/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9901832c-8865-46c1-ba6c-8c5e7a94b4fa", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "North Korean hackers breached a US tech company to steal crypto", "url": "https://reuters.com/technology/n-korea-hackers-breached-us-it-company-bid-steal-crypto-sources-2023-07-20/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "hash": "b8e8e876b26fe764803f831d21f7bbb76946ad1aa55353a80e9ab31ff403e65f"}}, "hash": "7a80cfcc164566f0676787518f47d950036e2de692a60c070931c5f7c9ca9f15", "text": "objectives has been generating revenue for the regime,\" he said.\nPyongyang's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Researchers are reporting SHERLOC's findings from 10 places on two geological formations on the floor of Jezero crater.\nThey obtained evidence indicating the presence of organic molecules in multiple rock samples, including some collected for potential return to Earth for future analysis.

Time is a slippery thing, as profound thinkers like physicist Albert Einstein and, well, fictional time traveler Dr. Who plainly understood. The latter, in a 2007 episode of the British sci-fi series, accurately described time as \"wibbly wobbly.\"\nScientists made that point anew on Monday in a study that used observations of a ferocious class of black holes called quasars to demonstrate \"time dilation\" in the early universe, showing how time then passed only about a fifth as quickly as it does today. The observations stretch back to about 12.3 billion years ago, when the universe was roughly a tenth its present age.\nQuasars - among the brightest objects in the universe - were used as a \"clock\" in the study to measure time in the deep past. Quasars are tremendously active supermassive black holes millions to billions of times more massive than our sun, usually residing at centers of galaxies. They devour matter drawn to them by their immense gravitational pull and unleash torrents of radiation including jets of high-energy particles, while a glowing disk of matter spins around them.\nThe researchers used observations involving the brightness of 190 quasars across the universe dating to about 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang event that gave rise to the cosmos. They compared the brightness of these quasars at various wavelengths to that of quasars existing today, finding that certain fluctuations that occur in a particular amount of time today did so five times more slowly in the most ancient quasars.\nEinstein, in his general theory of relativity, showed that time and space are intertwined and that the universe has been expanding outward in all directions since the Big Bang.\nAstrophysicist", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1748, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "085207fc-6675-49b5-9bd2-93f4509bbcbb": {"__data__": {"id_": "085207fc-6675-49b5-9bd2-93f4509bbcbb", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Ferocious black holes reveal 'time dilation' in early universe", "url": "https://reuters.com/technology/space/ferocious-black-holes-reveal-time-dilation-early-universe-2023-07-03/", "date": "2023-07-03 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b4faf7d-9ac5-4d11-a652-0c61fb197945", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Ferocious black holes reveal 'time dilation' in early universe", "url": "https://reuters.com/technology/space/ferocious-black-holes-reveal-time-dilation-early-universe-2023-07-03/", "date": "2023-07-03 00:00:00"}, "hash": "843b9c7edb530be3f6e08314cbf9fd02bd787f1318eae4d0b7adad7ab9b55426"}}, "hash": "4a115dc58a881a7921ba5322f13a881823116dc07856f7f7a04c9217b30109cf", "text": "has been expanding outward in all directions since the Big Bang.\nAstrophysicist Geraint Lewis of the University of Sydney in Australia, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy, said this continual expansion explains how time flowed more slowly earlier in the universe's history relative to today.\nIt is not as if everything was in slow motion. If you could be transported back to that time, a second would still feel like a second to you. But from the perspective of a person today, a second back then would unfold in five seconds now.\n\"In modern physics, time is a complicated thing,\" Lewis said. \"Dr. Who had it right, that time is best described as 'wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey stuff.' This means that we don't really understand time and its limitation, and some things are still not ruled out: time travel, warp drives, etc. The future could be very exciting, though maybe not.\"\nBy looking at faraway objects, scientists peer back in time because of how long it takes for light to travel through space.\nScientists previously documented time dilation dating to roughly 7 billion years ago, based on observations of stellar explosions called supernovas. Already knowing the time it takes for today's supernovas to brighten and fade, they studied these explosions in the past - those at great distances from Earth - and found that these events unfolded more slowly then from our time perspective.\nThe explosion of individual stars cannot be seen beyond a certain distance away, limiting their use in studying the early universe.

The cybersecurity-focused podcast Risky Business earlier this week cited two sources as saying that North Korea was a suspect in the intrusion.\nLabyrinth Chollima is one of North", "start_char_idx": 1691, "end_char_idx": 3385, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a7f7739e-c67d-46d0-845d-987cc538850f": {"__data__": {"id_": "a7f7739e-c67d-46d0-845d-987cc538850f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "North Korean hackers breached a US tech company to steal crypto", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/n-korea-hackers-breached-us-it-company-bid-steal-crypto-sources-2023-07-20/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "80ffd4b4-a919-4c84-b28f-fbe63278ae50", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "North Korean hackers breached a US tech company to steal crypto", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/technology/n-korea-hackers-breached-us-it-company-bid-steal-crypto-sources-2023-07-20/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "hash": "cf3ce1090d10b91bb197cf2a0f3f71c2d9c553b1da8a6bb2e50b2cb6bbc14ffd"}}, "hash": "e59d8a8a0055b996854bee915e69053e214874572697c8481ff72383f1cd1a3a", "text": "a suspect in the intrusion.\nLabyrinth Chollima is one of North Korea\u2019s most prolific hacking groups and is said to be responsible for some of the isolated country\u2019s most daring and disruptive cyber intrusions.

Leone continues to be part of both Sequoia\u2019s seed and growth teams.

Less than two years ago, the firm announced that it was \u201cbreaking with the traditional organization\u201d based on fund cycles and restructuring Sequoia Capital around a singular, permanent structure that would allow it to hold public shares long after a portfolio goes public (versus distributing the shares to its investors). The decision, said Sequoia, would also enable the firm to \u201cfurther increase our investments in emerging asset classes such as cryptocurrencies.\u201d\nWhile over the long term the move may prove fruitful, its timing proved inauspicious. Roughly six months after Sequoia restructured, the broader markets tanked, dragging down the price of public company shares that Sequoia\u2019s investors might otherwise have sold.

Netflix, which once supported the practice of account password-sharing, now finds it posing complex challenges to its business prospects.\nIt began testing the restriction last year, much to many subscribers\u2019 chagrin, and expanded it to a number of other countries including Canada, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain and the U.S. in 2023. In some aforementioned markets, Netflix allowed those sharing the password to pay extra to accommodate their friends.\nThe firm has clarified that it won\u2019t be introducing an additional membership option for customers in countries where it\u2019s newly enforcing account sharing restrictions. The reason behind this decision is the relatively low market penetration in these markets, along with the availability of more economical Netflix subscription tiers, the company wrote in a letter to shareholders.\n\u201cIn these markets, we\u2019re not offering an extra member option given that we\u2019ve recently cut prices in a good number of these countries (for example, Indonesia, Croatia, Kenya, and India) and penetration is still relatively low in many of them so we have plenty of runway without creating additional complexity.

Check out my podcast for an overview.)\nAgain this year, with no second lottery on the horizon, these are important questions to ask.\nStill, I believe it\u2019s still worth it to register employees in the annual H-1B lottery as part of a multiprong strategy to attract and retain international talent in the United States, as the six-year, dual-intent status is so valuable to companies and the team members who hold it.\nThat remains true even if the USCIS implements a proposal to increase the H-1B lottery registration fee to $215, up from the recent $10 fee. Although it\u2019s a large increase, the additional $205 per registration likely won\u2019t be a limiting factor for even early-stage startups considering the process.\nThe chances of having an H-1B candidate picked in the lottery has dropped dramatically, particularly since 2020, when the USCIS implemented its online H-1B lottery registration system. Before 2020, companies that wanted to enter an employee or prospective employee in the H-1B lottery had to submit a completed H-1B application.\nThis time-intensive, costly, and risky process often meant that participating in the H-1B lottery was unrealistic for most startups. Additionally, companies had to be ready to front the full filing fees at the time of the lottery, not knowing how many people would be selected and how many checks would be cashed.

However, the USCIS could look at alternative administrative changes, such as limiting each H-1B candidate to one entry in the H-1B lottery regardless if that individual has multiple job offers, in order to provide a more level playing field.\nThis year\u2019s H-1B lottery\nWhile getting job offers from multiple companies that register an H-1B candidate in the lottery is not against the law, the USCIS indicated it would closely scrutinize H-1B beneficiaries, companies, and applications for potential abuses and fraud.\nAfter this year\u2019s lottery, the USCIS stated:\nThe large number of eligible registrations for beneficiaries with multiple eligible registrations \u2014 much larger than in previous years \u2014 has raised serious concerns that some may have tried to gain an unfair advantage by working together to submit multiple registrations on behalf of the same beneficiary.

Most of the revenue came from Tesla\u2019s automotive revenue, which hit $21.3 billion in Q2.

The automaker has been opening its network of Superchargers to other automakers in recent months, notably Ford and General Motors, and most recently Nissan.

The company says it has more than 175 million downloads and is present in 655 cities across 48 countries.\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of InDrive, it might be because the company has more of a presence outside the traditional Western world. Originally from Siberia, InDrive divested its Russian entity in July 2022 after Russia\u2019s war with Ukraine began in March that year. The company says it has no other plans for investment in Russia.\nInDrive\u2019s top markets are in Latin America (Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador) and Asia (Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Pakistan, India).\nIn February InDrive raised $150 million in debt financing from General Catalyst, and since then has been expanding aggressively into new territories. The company recently announced plans to expand to 15 new cities in Nigeria, and has had a presence in Africa for years.\nSo why America, and why now?

So unlike my peers, we put the drivers and consumers first by bringing transparency and fairness to ride-sharing.\u201d\nSounds great! What could go wrong?\nApparently a few things.\nA quick perusal of app reviews demonstrate a plethora of issues customers have had with the app and the service \u2014 issues that probably won\u2019t fly with an American audience.\nUber and Lyft, for all their questionable ethics, ensure reliable rides and service by hitting drivers with a combination of incentives and punishments for accepting or declining rides. InDrive has more of a conscience, but that could lead to longer wait times for riders or riders repeatedly getting canceled on.\nWarner said InDrive is working on its marketing push to get as many drivers signed up as possible so that if one driver cancels, there will be another waiting in the wings. One way the company is attracting drivers is by refraining from charging a commission from July 2023 to January 2024, meaning the drivers will take home up to 100% of each fare (subject to airport fees and highway tolls). InDrive\u2019s usual fee is around 10% of each ride. Uber and Lyft take 25%.\nThe company is also promising to maintain a minimum ride price of $10 in Miami. Today, InDrive has 3,500 drivers in South Florida signed up for launch.\nCustomers also complained about InDrive\u2019s customer service being sub-par when dealing with issues like frequent driver cancellations, or drivers changing up the agreed upon fare at pickup.

That\u2019s not a small number, but compared to competitors, it does mean InDrive has had to stay lean, which can affect the quality of the product. Customers reviewing the app also complained that it was buggy, that ETAs were off, and that drivers didn\u2019t always know how to get from A to B. Part of that last problem is because InDrive doesn\u2019t have its own proprietary mapping and GPS system, as its peers do, which Warner says is a huge cost.\n\u201cWe give the drivers the freedom of choice to be able to switch on their own mapping services,\u201d said Warner. \u201cWe\u2019re not heavily invested into that particular part of it.

But that\u2019s not impossible, and InDrive isn\u2019t in a huge rush to take over the U.S.\nWarner said the company is focused on solving the transportation needs in South Florida first, and doing so in a way that\u2019s sustainable.\n\u201cInDrive is definitely open to expanding its footprint in the United States, really focusing on markets with insufficient mobility and public transportation options,\u201d said Warner. \u201cAlso markets that have high travel costs and emerging tourism.\u201d", "start_char_idx": 3347, "end_char_idx": 4906, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c9bcbd86-d877-42a6-a714-39133a44422a": {"__data__": {"id_": "c9bcbd86-d877-42a6-a714-39133a44422a", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "First sneak peek at the judges for Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/first-sneak-peek-at-the-judges-for-startup-battlefield-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2023/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "345ae37c-bda5-43b1-b589-e964f74eeee5", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "First sneak peek at the judges for Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023", "url": "https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/20/first-sneak-peek-at-the-judges-for-startup-battlefield-at-techcrunch-disrupt-2023/", "date": "2023-07-20 00:00:00"}, "hash": "6c44fd300675f0c7a7f99ebe1b3377c36f2ef50da6cb3f1157d05d6599b4265d"}}, "hash": "7bed32eecde75dff74bd1ca570ef326a4cb3bff4a04c756cc2b534e110d5f1ce", "text": "First sneak peek at the judges for Startup Battlefield at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023\nThe Startup Battlefield pitch competition is the crown jewel of Disrupt, and we can\u2019t wait to see which of the Startup Battlefield 200 companies will be selected to pitch to panels of top-tier VCs at TechCrunch Disrupt 2023 on September 19\u201321 in San Francisco.

Today, right on schedule and in time for the launch of Chrome 115 into the stable release channel, Google announced that it will now start enabling the relevance and measurement APIs in its browser. This will be a gradual rollout, with Google aiming for a 99% availability by mid-August.\nAt this point, Google doesn\u2019t expect to make any major changes to the APIs. This includes virtually all of the core Privacy Sandbox features, including Topics, Protected Audience, Attribution Reporting, Private Aggregation, Shared Storage and Fenced Frames.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that for the time being, Privacy Sandbox will run in parallel with third-party cookies in the browser. It won\u2019t be until early 2024 that Google will deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users. After that, the process will speed up though and Google will deprecate these cookies for all users by the second half of 2024.\nPreviously, the ad tech industry was already able to test its readiness for the eventual third-party cookie deprecation, in part through the Relevance and Measurement origin trial. With these features moving into general availability, Google will end this trial (and revoke the tokens to run experiments) on September 20, 2023.\nFor Chrome users, Google will also now start rolling out its user interface to allow them to manage Privacy Sandbox data in the browser, including ad topics, site-suggested ads and ad measurement data.

It also says it can spot it when suppliers\u2019 try to send estimated bills rather than final ones.\nThe new feature is on the free tier of Nous membership, currently works with energy bills and will soon be extended to broadband, mobile phone and insurance documents, with alerts delivered via WhatsApp.\nAccording to the company\u2019s own research, two thirds of people in the UK find it difficult to understand their energy bills and only 15% say they read the small print.\nAfter just over 12 months of development in private beta, Nous soon plans to offer a subscription service as its premium product, focusing on clear billing and customer reassurance regarding data privacy. The free product will serve as an onboarding tool and customer acquisition funnel for the premium service.

An increasing alternative to in-house hiring is to engage with staffing agencies or BPOs to outsource operations or to use platforms, such as Upwork or Fiverr to find freelancers who can handle process-oriented tasks. However, this has become a significant cost factor due to ongoing inflation. Gushwork.ai strives to address this problem in the market using its AI-powered, cross-border platform.\nThe startup provides a curated marketplace that features offshore workers trained in using various AI applications to help businesses carry out their processes efficiently.

These can be generating photorealistic blog designs, converting webinars to blogs, generating images for blog writing, writing blog posts on different topics or even doing search engine optimization. Generative AI tools have enabled large workforces to perform such creative tasks without requiring special skills.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need a 3D graphic designer per se, or you don\u2019t need to spend three months trying to find the right 3D graphic designer or the photorealistic image copy generator on Upwork or Fiverr,\u201d Bhattacharya noted.\nGushwork.ai has trained its AI-augmented workforce to perform tasks, such as lead prospecting, email marketing, ad management, lead engagement on social media platforms, webinar moderation and marketing, social media management, responding to inbound leads, CRM setup, social media analytics data scraping, prospect outreach and ad campaign management, among others. These are all initially aimed at easing sales and marketing operations workflows. However, the startup also plans to expand into more specialized roles in the future.\nWithin the first three months of operation, Gushwork.ai saw more than 50 businesses adopting its platform to delegate over 200 complex workflows.

Nissan aims to make that 1% or less.\nNissan, which also makes the March subcompact and Infiniti luxury models, is working on solid-state battery technology for EVs, a move that if successful is expected to radically reduce costs.\nBy 2030, Nissan\u2019s EV offerings will cost about the same at dealers as the equivalent regular gasoline-engine models, Hirai said.\nThe cheapest EVs like the Leaf now sell for under $30,000, although small internal-combustion engine cars are cheaper, at about $21,000 for the Nissan Sentra in the U.S.\nA Tesla Model 3, a relatively affordable model for a Tesla, sells for about $43,000.\nBut EVs are usually eligible for tax credits and other incentives. High gasoline prices might make EVs a smart buy in the long run, although much depends on the owner\u2019s driving habits.\nA Consumer Reports analysis last year said that based on the gas price at that time of $4.31 a gallon, EV owners could save between $1,800 and $2,600 in operating and maintenance costs for every 15,000 miles they drive, compared to drivers of gas-powered vehicles.\nThat\u2019s the average distance newer vehicles are driven in a year in the U.S. Gas prices have since fallen, so the savings would be lower but still significant.\nHirai said people", "start_char_idx": 1637, "end_char_idx": 3271, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bbd19352-3d93-4dec-9645-61e3a1a38935": {"__data__": {"id_": "bbd19352-3d93-4dec-9645-61e3a1a38935", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Japan\u2019s Nissan slashing EV costs, cuts rare materials use", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/nissan-electric-vehicles-rare-earths-92e953edca010476124c45a8544f5b38", "date": "2023-03-09 01:21:41"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d47a498a-861d-4ea1-8424-f2aa9d30211a", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Japan\u2019s Nissan slashing EV costs, cuts rare materials use", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/nissan-electric-vehicles-rare-earths-92e953edca010476124c45a8544f5b38", "date": "2023-03-09 01:21:41"}, "hash": "f0d8fa1398dd7da3a7e2665874db0be74e2089da621943f28aa3fb073de0348a"}}, "hash": "bf62cba2bad0a82bab356a83de4c0024fddce32bddccb32bfcbe66eee801bba0", "text": "fallen, so the savings would be lower but still significant.\nHirai said people find driving an electric vehicle less stressful because it\u2019s quiet and delivers a smooth ride, even over rough terrain, while maintaining the fun feel of driving.

In addition to the layoffs, Meta said Tuesday that it would not fill 5,000 open positions.\n\u201cThis will be tough and there\u2019s no way around that,\u201d said CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\nMeta and other tech companies have been hiring aggressively for at least two years and in recent months have begun to let some of those workers go . Hiring in the U.S. is still strong, but layoffs have hit hard in some sectors.\nEarly last month, Meta posted falling profits and its third consecutive quarter of declining revenue. On the same day, the company said that it would buy back as much as $40 billion of its own stock.\nThe Menlo Park, company said Tuesday it will reduce the size of its recruiting team and make further cuts in its tech groups in late April, and then its business groups in late May.\nZuckerberg has invested tens of billions of dollars building out its", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1724, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc6606a7-9c1c-4a91-8111-55990b353c8c": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc6606a7-9c1c-4a91-8111-55990b353c8c", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "A 2nd wave of layoffs at Meta; 10,000 jobs are cut", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-job-cuts-f193ca0e67078c04a8433f6c74a83187", "date": "2023-03-14 13:36:41"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c6727a99-84a3-4845-b1e9-1ab158377275", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "A 2nd wave of layoffs at Meta; 10,000 jobs are cut", "url": "https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-job-cuts-f193ca0e67078c04a8433f6c74a83187", "date": "2023-03-14 13:36:41"}, "hash": "7bac047f03e4bcd023dd65770809d91450834c7b65fd713196238d311a43d433"}}, "hash": "3b8cf6bb45c8692cd35bc96422442a987f6ee5f4a621be4dc2098241f23c0e84", "text": "has invested tens of billions of dollars building out its metaverse, its virutal reality concept, and renamed the company Meta, signaling a new focus for Facebook.\n\u201cAs I\u2019ve talked about efficiency this year, I\u2019ve said that part of our work will involve removing jobs -- and that will be in service of both building a leaner, more technical company and improving our business performance to enable our long term vision,\u201d said Zuckerberg.\nThe biggest tech companies in the U.S. are cutting costs elsewhere, too.\nThis month, Amazon paused construction on its second headquarters in Virginia following the biggest round of layoffs in the company\u2019s history and its shifting plans around remote work.\nGlobal inflation has remained stubborn and its made for more difficult decisions for both households and businesses in the U.S .\nFast growth companies, including many in the technology sector, are hunkering down for what may be an extended period of adverse economic conditions.\n\u201cAt this point, I think we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that this new economic reality will continue for many years,\u201d Zuckerberg said in a message to employees.\nMeta shares rose nearly 7% Tuesday.", "start_char_idx": 1667, "end_char_idx": 2853, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bb51bac8-3b02-4dc4-9199-1fd390a37dbe": {"__data__": {"id_": "bb51bac8-3b02-4dc4-9199-1fd390a37dbe", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Analysis: Biotech IPOs to bloom with spotlight on startups with human trial data", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/biotech-ipos-bloom-with-spotlight-startups-with-human-trial-data-2023-02-13/", "date": "2023-02-13 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c96d9976-6344-4d0d-b5d8-e23cbbd71a30", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Analysis: Biotech IPOs to bloom with spotlight on startups with human trial data", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/biotech-ipos-bloom-with-spotlight-startups-with-human-trial-data-2023-02-13/", "date": "2023-02-13 00:00:00"}, "hash": "65bafe795e6621b0b8a3024714710dee8a51909b381c0b69d2366033f8b600a2"}}, "hash": "5833bb8e4094da67c19b2cd29b9a19f2b6f5379c85330329c754cbc307c284d3", "text": "Feb 13 (Reuters) -

IKEA, the world's biggest furniture brand, said on Wednesday its annual carbon emissions fell 5% in the last fiscal year following efforts to boost renewable energy use and make its products more energy efficient.\nIKEA has a target to be climate positive - reducing more greenhouse gas emissions than its value chain emits - by 2030.\nIt said emissions in the entire value chain - from raw material production to customers' use and disposal of products - was estimated to total 25.8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in the 12 months through August 2022, against an upwardly revised 27.2 million tonnes in the 2021 fiscal year.\nOne of the main drivers of the reduction was the development of a more energy efficient LED bulb range called \"Solhetta\", said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, chief executive of the Inter IKEA Group that owns the IKEA brand.\nHelping suppliers to use more renewable energy in countries such as China - by getting them discounted loans and framework agreements to increase their access to clean power - also contributed to the emissions cut, he told Reuters.\nInter IKEA acts as franchisor to IKEA store owners and is in charge of supply.\nAbrahamsson Ring said earlier that retail sales volumes did not increase in fiscal year 2022 as IKEA struggled to meet demand due to supply shortages. Retail sales were up on the back of price hikes, to 44.6 billion euros.\nIngka Group, which owns most IKEA stores worldwide, reduced its own emissions by 23% to 455,014 tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The store owner's emission reduction was also achieved by using more renewable energy.\nReporting by Marie Mannes and Anna Ringstrom", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 1658, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "2a9fe894-4110-448e-92f8-104fb36549a2": {"__data__": {"id_": "2a9fe894-4110-448e-92f8-104fb36549a2", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "IKEA says shrinks climate footprint with help from new light bulbs", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/ikea-says-shrinks-climate-footprint-with-help-new-light-bulbs-2023-02-15/", "date": "2023-02-15 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1d5c7fba-2a6d-4fb0-9af1-d9d1003bc4c2", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "IKEA says shrinks climate footprint with help from new light bulbs", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/markets/carbon/ikea-says-shrinks-climate-footprint-with-help-new-light-bulbs-2023-02-15/", "date": "2023-02-15 00:00:00"}, "hash": "1f2a7b41e25c1760d86e9f779b1c94e7bf5dafe7dad06c50e12e3555db6332b2"}}, "hash": "205b8dcdd2c107af861602b99a14249bd6a0dab2cc4118f7c12c4fa0b73c3628", "text": "by using more renewable energy.\nReporting by Marie Mannes and Anna Ringstrom Editing by Helen Popper\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.", "start_char_idx": 1582, "end_char_idx": 1735, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "fcc689f4-02ea-4eb7-bdbf-ee5e56047ba9": {"__data__": {"id_": "fcc689f4-02ea-4eb7-bdbf-ee5e56047ba9", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"title": "Aldi UK to recruit 6,000 after strong Christmas trading", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/aldi-uk-recruit-6000-after-strong-christmas-trading-2023-02-16/", "date": "2023-02-16 00:00:00"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9a110bcd-9470-421b-bfc4-42c9ac5cb990", "node_type": null, "metadata": {"title": "Aldi UK to recruit 6,000 after strong Christmas trading", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/aldi-uk-recruit-6000-after-strong-christmas-trading-2023-02-16/", "date": "2023-02-16 00:00:00"}, "hash": "e498c375765f3d8263ef41588a5b99ea3d4e3a6965cb2a33afb4d4d97f3e2730"}}, "hash": "8211c583a0e40826850f9ed1da64d49ff89739b1f316f0daebe92a5f27d7a11c", "text": "LONDON, Feb 16 (Reuters) - The British arm of German discounter Aldi said on Thursday it was looking to hire more than 6,000 workers, continuing its expansion plans after a robust performance over the key holiday season.\nNew stores were planned in Norwich and Newcastle in England, it said in a statement.

Big tech companies in the U.S. and China rushed this month to announce they are working on similar AI tools. Their announcements often referenced Microsoft-backed ChatGPT, while disclosing few details on what they themselves were working on. The artificial intelligence-powered chatbot ChatGPT has taken the tech world by storm in the last few months with its ability to generate everything from poems to business strategies in a human-like conversation. Still, analysts say the tech is transformative, something that's also been said about blockchain and the metaverse.\nCompetitive landscape\nHere's what companies \u2014 including those in China \u2014 are doing in this specialized area of AI: U.S. startup OpenAI raced to beat rivals by launching ChatGPT in November, according to The New York Times, citing sources.

While sales of Microsoft's Xbox consoles are slowing down, the company has been drawing on its cash pile to expand the collection of games it can sell and allow people to play through its cloud data centers.\nMicrosoft President Brad Smith said at a press conference that, effective immediately, its Xbox games will be available on Nvidia's GeForce Now cloud games service. Smith said if the Activision deal closes, it will bring all Activision Blizzard titles to GeForce Now.\nNvidia is now on board with Microsoft's pending deal for regulatory purposes, the two companies said in a joint statement confirming the two companies 10-year deal.

The EU commission said last year it is concerned that Microsoft could block access to the game on other platforms if the deal goes through.\nThe commission is also concerned that it could give Microsoft an unfair edge in the nascent area of cloud gaming. Microsoft has a service called Game Pass through which it charges gamers $9.99 per month to access a library of games. The Activision takeover would add some high-profile titles to Game Pass.\nNvidia's GeForce Now has over 25 million members, while Microsoft said last year that 25 million people subscribe to Game Pass. Nvidia offers free and paid GeForce Now tiers, although high resolution is only available to those who pay. Members of GeForce Now will be able to stream through the cloud the games they buy through Microsoft's app store, along with games listed in Epic Games and Steam's app stores.\nIn December, Microsoft said it had \"entered into a 10-year commitment\" to bring Call of Duty to Nintendo when the Activision acquisition closes.

Zaslav elbowed Netflix for releasing all of the episodes for a program\u2019s cycle all at once; suggested that a move to launch new \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d movies would take away some of the momentum that Amazon had enjoyed from its launch of a series based on the novels; and told listeners Warner Bros.

REUTERS/Joe Skipper\nCAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., Feb 27 (Reuters) - NASA and SpaceX early on Monday postponed the launch of a capsule containing two U.S. astronauts, a Russian cosmonaut and a United Arab Emirates crewmate minutes before scheduled lift-off from Florida on a flight to the International Space Station.\nThe U.S. space agency and SpaceX, the private rocket company founded by billionaire Elon Musk, cited a technical glitch concerning the ignition fluid used to start the spacecraft's engines.\nThe countdown had seemed to be progressing smoothly until about two and a half minutes before blastoff, when NASA announced on its live webcast that the launch of the four crew members on a six-month science mission would be postponed.\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket topped with a Crew Dragon capsule had been scheduled for liftoff at 1:45 a.m. EST (0645 GMT) from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nThe first backup launch opportunity for the mission was set for early Tuesday, about 24 hours from the initial attempt to get the rocket off the ground.\nNeither NASA nor SpaceX immediately said how long it might actually take before they would be ready to try again.
